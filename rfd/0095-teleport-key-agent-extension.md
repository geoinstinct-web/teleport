# RFD 95 - Teleport Key Agent Extension

## Required Approvers (TBD)

## What

Extend Teleport Key Agent to allow users to make `tsh` requests from within a remote session started with `tsh ssh -A`.

## Why

It's already possible to `ssh` from a remote session in this way, but `tsh` requires more than just an SSH certificate and private key to start a session. At the minimum, `tsh` also needs a TLS certificate and proxy address to form connections to a Teleport proxy. To avoid using `tsh --insecure`, the remote session will also need access to a list of SSH and TLS CA certificates.

Thus, we need a secure protocol for sharing certificates and other relevant data on the local host with the remote host. We can lean on the [extensible](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4251#section-4.2) SSH Agent protocol for this, by implementing custom extensions for retrieving TLS certificates, CA certificates, and even perform per-session MFA signatures with the Teleport Key Agent.

## Details

### Teleport Key Agent Changes

We will add new [SSH Agent extensions](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-miller-ssh-agent#section-4.7) to forward additional `tsh` keystore items and functions, namely TLS certificates, CA certificates, known hosts, and per-session MFA reissue. Basic SSH Agent functionality will not be impacted by adding these extensions, so existing integrations will remain unchanged.

To support these extensions, `tsh` will need to be updated to extend the current Teleport Key Agent and add a new Teleport Key Agent client. The Teleport Key Agent client can be used by `tsh` calls on a remote host to send SSH Agent requests to the Teleport Key Agent running on the local host.

#### SSH Agent Extensions

**Extension Structure:**

Extension requests consist of:

        byte            SSH_AGENTC_EXTENSION
        string          extension type (type@domain)
        byte[]          extension contents

An Extension response can be any custom message, but failures should result in `SSH_AGENT_EXTENSION_FAILURE`. Unsupported extensions should result in an `SSH_AGENT_FAILURE` response to differentiate from actual extension failures.

**Teleport Identity Extension:**

This extension requests a partial Teleport Identity from the agent matching the provided public key and Teleport identifiers. Clients should provide the public key part of a Teleport agent key, since a matching TLS certificate should be available in the local agent's key store. The Teleport cluster, proxy, and user can also be found in the Teleport agent key.

For session requests that require per-session MFA, clients can provide the `require_mfa` flag to issue a single time use mfa-verified certificate.

        byte            SSH_AGENTC_EXTENSION
        string          identity@goteleport.com
        string          public key SHA
        string          proxy
        string          cluster
        string          user
        bool            require_mfa

The returned x509 certificate can be used to perform a TLS handshake.

        byte            SSH_AGENT_SUCCESS
        string          TLS certificate
        string[]        trusted CA certificate
        string[]        known hosts contents

#### SSH Agent Key Constraint Extensions

For Per-session MFA SSH certificates, we *could* include the SSH certificate in the extension response above, but we'd be missing a great opportunity. Instead, we can add a new [key constraint extension](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-miller-ssh-agent#section-4.2.6.3) to add per-session MFA functionality into the Teleport Key Agent in a way that would work with `ssh` as well. This would extend per-session MFA functionality to OpenSSH integrations, including [OpenSSH Proxy Jump](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/17190).

This constraint will not be supported by the standard SSH Agent, so this extension's impact will be limited. In this implementation, this key constraint will only be utilized in remote connections initiated with `tsh ssh --forward-agent=local`. In order for users to utilize this key locally - e.g. `tsh login && ssh node-with-per-session-mfa` - we would need to introduce a `tsh agent` to replace the user's standard SSH agent on their local machine. I will leave this topic for a future RFD, if desired.

**Extension Structure:**

Key constraints can be used to limit when and how a key can be used. They can be included when adding any of the existing key types.

Key constraint extensions consist of:

        byte            SSH_AGENT_CONSTRAIN_EXTENSION
        string          extension name (name@domain)
        byte[]          extension-specific details

If an unsupported constraint extension is provided, the add key request will return an `SSH_AGENT_FAILURE`.

**Per-session MFA Key Constraint Extension:**

This key constraint extension can be used to add a per-session MFA key.

        byte            SSH_AGENT_CONSTRAIN_EXTENSION
        string          per-session-mfa@goteleport.com

The private key part of this key will be used for signing operations, but the certificate part, if any, will be ignored. Instead, the Teleport Key Agent will issue a new `IssueUserCertsWithMFA` request and use the returned certificates directly. The `tsh` process running the Teleport Key Agent will thus prompt the user for touch during the reissue request.

To avoid using this key when a non per-session MFA key is suitable, these keys will always be returned last by the [list keys operation](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-miller-ssh-agent#section-4.4).

### UX

Users will need to forward the Teleport Key Agent, rather than the System Key Agent forwarded by `tsh ssh -A`. As described in [RFD 22](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0022-ssh-agent-forwarding.md), this can be done with `tsh ssh -o "ForwardAgent local"`.

To improve UX, we can add an option via an env variable - `TELEPORT_FORWARD_AGENT`, and a [tsh config file](https://goteleport.com/docs/reference/cli/#tsh-configuration-files) value - `AgentForward`. This way, `tsh ssh -A` could check these values before defaulting to the System Key Agent.

### Security

#### SSH Agent Forwarding Risks and Constraints

SSH Agent forwarding introduces an inherent risk. When a user does `ssh -A` or `tsh ssh -A`, their forwarded keys could be used by a user on the remote machine with root permissions over the remote user. However, it should not be possible to export any sensitive data from a user's forwarded Key Agent. This criteria prohibits some potential options, such as providing the user's raw private key via the `identity@goteleport.com` extension.

#### Per-session MFA

The per-session MFA certificate returned in the `identity@goteleport.com` extension introduces a slight vulnerability in per-session MFA. Currently, per-session MFA certificates are only held in memory and are never exportable. The new extension makes it possible for a user to run the extension and export the certificate. This certificate would still be limited to a 1 minute TTL, but could in theory be used for unintended purposes outside of ["establishing a single session"](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0014-session-2FA.md#constraints). This factor also contributed to the choice to use a key constraint extension for the mfa-verified SSH certificate instead.

### Additional Considerations

#### Incompatibilities

The majority of `tsh` calls will work, but features which require a raw private key will not.

TODO: investigate which features won't work, experiment with getting Kubernetes Access to work.
