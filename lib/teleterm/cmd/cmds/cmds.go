// Cmds represents a single command in two variants â€“ one that can be used to spawn a process and
// one that can be copied and pasted into a terminal.
//
// Defined in a separate package to avoid cyclic imports. CLI commands got refactored in v15+ anyway.
type Cmds struct {
	// Exec is the command that should be used when directly executing a command for the given
	// gateway.

	// Preview is the command that should be used to display the command in the UI. Typically this
	// means that Preview includes quotes around special characters, so that the command gets executed
	// properly when the user copies and then pastes it into a terminal.
