//! This module contains static structures which are used in common by all
//! desktop sessions on a given windows_desktop_service.
//!
//! ## Constraints
//!
//! The primary constraint for maintainers to keep in mind is that these
//! structures can in effect be accessed by multiple threads at any given
//! time via Go. Therefore, typical Rust concurrency semantics must be
//! carefully observed (the compiler will not necessarily catch violations).
//!
//! In practice this primarily means ensuring that such global, static
//! structures are [`Send`] + [`Sync`] and are only mutated when locked.
