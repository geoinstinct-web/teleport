// On Windows we use auxiliary .lock.tmp files to acquire locks, so we can still read/write target
// files themselves.
//
// .lock.tmp files are deliberately not cleaned up. Their presence doesn't matter to the actual
// locking. Repeatedly removing them on unlock when acquiring dozens of locks in a short timespan
// was causing flock.Flock.TryRLock to return either "access denied" or "The process cannot access
// the file because it is being used by another process".
