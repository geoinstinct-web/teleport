// AddHostToHostList adds a new hostname to PuTTY's list of trusted hostnames for a given host CA.
//
// Background:
//   - For every host CA that it is configured to trust, PuTTY maintains a list of hostnames (hostList) which it should consider
//     to be valid for that host CA. This is the same as the @cert-authority lines in an `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file.
//   - Trusted hostnames can be individual entries (host1, host2) or wildcards like "*.example.com".
//   - PuTTY keeps this list of hostnames stored against each host CA in the Windows registry. It exposes a GUI (under
//     Connection -> SSH -> Host Keys -> Configure Host CAs at the time of writing) which expects any new host CAs and
//     trusted hostnames for each to be added manually by end users as part of session configuration.
//   - This process is mandatory for validation of host CAs in PuTTY to work, but is a cumbersome manual process with many
//     clicks required in a nested interface. Instead, this function is called as part of `tsh puttyconfig` to examine the
//     existing list of trusted hostnames and automate the process of adding a new valid hostname to a given host CA.
//
// Connection flow:
//   - When connecting to a host which presents a host CA, PuTTY searches its list of CAs to find any which are considered
//     valid for that hostname, then checks whether the host's presented CA matches any of them. If there is a CA -> hostname
//     match, the connection will continue successfully. If not, an error will be shown.
//
// Intended behaviour of this function:
//   - This function is passed the current list of trusted hostnames for a given host CA (retrieved from the registry), along
//     with a new hostname entry (from tsh puttyconfig <hostname>) which should be added to the list.
//   - It appends the new hostname to the end of the hostList
//   - All hostnames in the hostList are converted to their wildcard form if they contain a dot (test.example.com -> *.example.com)
//     and are grouped together.
//   - If a wildcard group only contains a single hostname which would be matched by its wildcard equivalent, that hostname is added
//     to the hostList verbatim to prevent inadvertently matching against too many hosts with the same wildcard.
//   - If a wildcard matches more than one hostname, the wildcard will be added to the hostList instead and the single hostnames
//     discarded.
//   - The hostList is then sorted alphabetically and returned.
//
// This is an effort to keep the length of hostList as short as possible for efficiency and tidiness, while not using any more
// wildcards than necessary and preventing the need for end users to manually configure their trusted host CAs.
