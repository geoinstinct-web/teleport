## Before submitting a new issue

Before filing a new issue, search https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22flaky+tests%22 for
the flaky test's name to see if the same issue has already been reported. If so, double check the `Relevant snippet` to confirm that
the specific failure is the same. If it is, please react üëç to this issue (so we can sort issues by reactions). If you have a link to the
full log of the test run, please add it to the `Link(s) to logs` section below. If instead you've encountered a new failure, edit the issue
and copy paste in a new `Failure` section below the existing one(s).

If there's no existing issue for this test, continue to file a new one:

1. Change `TestName` in the title to the name of the test that failed.
2. Use `git blame` to try and figure out who is most responsible for the test, and assign them to this issue.
3. **Delete this entire section and continue**.

## Failure

#### Link(s) to logs

- Update the link below with the similar link to the logs of the test run that failed, **then delete this line**.
