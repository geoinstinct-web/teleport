These guides show you how to run a Teleport cluster on your infrastructure.

## Choose an edition

The first step in deploying Teleport is to choose an edition. There are three
Teleport editions available, and you can see a detailed comparison between them
on our [Frequently Asked
Questions](../faq.mdx#how-is-open-source-different-from-enterprise) page.

For each Teleport edition, you can follow one of our guides to try out a
small-scale demo deployment:

- Try [Teleport Community Edition](./open-source.mdx) on a Linux Server. You can
  also get started with a [Digital Ocean
  droplet](deployments/digitalocean.mdx).
- If you are interested in Teleport Enterprise, see our [getting started
  guide](./teleport-enterprise/getting-started.mdx) or read our [more detailed
  introduction](./teleport-enterprise/introduction.mdx) to our Enterprise-only
  features.
- Read our Teleport Enterprise Cloud [getting started
  guide](./teleport-cloud/getting-started.mdx) or see our
  [introduction](./teleport-cloud/introduction.mdx) for more information.

## Plan your deployment

Read our [High Availability Guide](./high-availability.mdx) for the general
principles behind deploying a scalable, fault-tolerant Teleport cluster. Once
you understand what is required to run Teleport in production, choose your
compute platform and cloud provider:

### Deploy on Kubernetes using Helm 

You can deploy a complete, high-availability Teleport cluster on Kubernetes
using our `teleport-cluster` Helm chart. These guides show you how to deploy the
`teleport-cluster` Helm chart on your cloud:

- [Google Cloud](./helm-deployments/gcp.mdx)
- [AWS](./helm-deployments/aws.mdx)
- [Kubernetes with SSO](./helm-deployments/kubernetes-cluster.mdx)
- [Custom Kubernetes Deployment](./helm-deployments/custom.mdx)
- [Migrating from our Legacy Helm Charts](./helm-deployments/migration.mdx)
- [Digital Ocean](./helm-deployments/digitalocean.mdx)

### Deploy using virtual machines

You can run a production cluster of Teleport instances using virtual machines.
In these guides, we will show you how to deploy a high-availability, VM-based
Teleport cluster on your cloud:

- [AWS with Terraform](./deployments/aws-terraform.mdx)
- [Google Cloud](./deployments/gcp.mdx)
- [IBM Cloud](./deployments/ibm.mdx)
