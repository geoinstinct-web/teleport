This guide will help you understand how to set up and use Teleport Assist, a new feature that enhances your remote access experience.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started with Teleport Assist, make sure you have the following:

1. **Teleport**: Ensure you have Teleport 12.4 or newer installed and running on your system.
You can check out the [Teleport Installation Guide](https://goteleport.com/docs/installation/) for more details.

2. **OpenAI Account**: You will need an active OpenAI account as Teleport Assist relies on OpenAI services.

## Step 1/4. Generate OpenAI API Key

Teleport uses the GPT-4 model for the Assist feature. Your account must have access to it if you want to use Teleport Assist.

Follow these steps to generate your OpenAI API key:

1. Sign in to your OpenAI account.
2. Navigate to the [API section](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) in your OpenAI dashboard.
3. Click on "Create new secret key".
4. Give your key a descriptive name.
5. Click "Create secret key".
6. Your new API key will be displayed. Make sure to copy it and save it in a file on your system.
7. Set read only permissions and change the file owner to `root` by running the following commands:

```bash
chmod 400 /etc/teleport/openai_key
chown root:root /etc/teleport/openai_key
```

Remember, your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas.

## Enable Assist

To enable Teleport Assist, you need to provide your OpenAI API key. Here's how to do it:

1. Open your Teleport configuration file. This is typically located at `/etc/teleport.yaml`.
2. Locate the `assist` section in the file. If it doesn't exist, create it in a Teleport Proxy section.
3. Add your OpenAI API key to the `assist` section:

 ```yaml
proxy_service:
  assist:
    openai:
      api_token_path: /etc/teleport/openai_key
```

4. Save the changes and close the file.
5. Restart your Teleport Proxy service for the changes to take effect.

You have now enabled Teleport Assist!

## Example Use

Now that you have Teleport Assist enabled, you can start using it to enhance your remote access experience.
Here's an example of how to use it:

1. Open Teleport's Web UI in your browser (e.g., https://teleport.example.com).
2. Login to the Web UI using your Teleport credentials.
3. Click on the "Assist" button in the top right context menu.
