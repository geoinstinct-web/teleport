## Content

**Keep it simple**

Read the book [On Writing Well](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Well-Classic-Guide-Nonfiction/dp/0060891548).

**Write for the target audience**

Do not overload getting started guides with content and complex terminology, focus
on benefits to the user. Do not add architecture diagrams in getting started guides.
Likewise, do not do demos in architecture articles.

**Keep guides self-contained**

All guides should have everything that is needed for a reader
to accomplish their goal. This sometimes leads to duplication.
Use include directives for repeated content. Remove backslash before the exclamation marks for it to work:

```bash
(\!CHANGELOG.md\!)
```

Filepath should be relative to the repository root folder.

## Diagrams

Use [Teleport's lucidchart library](https://app.lucidchart.com/lucidchart/dfcf1f4a-5cf0-4758-8ebb-f6ea86900aba/edit)
to create diagrams with a consistent design language.

## Videos

Mac users should use Quicktime's `Cmd-Shift-5` to record a small part of the screen:

![quicktime](../../img/docs/quicktime.webp)

**Convert Mov to MP4 and WebM**

Quicktime outputs large `.mov` files. Use `ffmpeg` to convert them into `mp4` and `webm`
web-friendly formats:

```bash
# create MP4
ffmpeg -i input.mov -b:v 0 -crf 25 output.mp4
# create WebM
ffmpeg -i input.mov -c vp9 -b:v 0 -crf 41 output.webm
```

**Embed videos**

```html
<video autoPlay loop muted playsInline>
  <source src="https://goteleport.com/teleport/videos/database-access-preview/dbaccessdemo.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <source src="https://goteleport.com/teleport/videos/database-access-preview/dbaccessdemo.webm" type="video/webm" />
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

To test videos locally, add them to the `../img/video` folder of the docs.
For production, upload to the website and refer from there:

```html
<video autoplay loop muted playsinline>
  <source src="https://goteleport.com/teleport/videos/database-access-preview/dbaccessdemo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="https://goteleport.com/teleport/videos/database-access-preview/dbaccessdemo.webm" type="video/webm">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

## Custom syntax used in the docs

### Varibles

To prevent updating links and code examples after each release, we can replace them with
variables. This way, it will be enough to update them in one place.

Variables are stored in the `docs/config.json` file under the key `variables`.
Variables can be nested inside the config.

To insert variabe to the page use `(\= path.to.variable \=)` syntax
(remove backslashes in actual code).

Variables will be linted on CI. If the variable didn't exist in the config, it would cause an error.

### Includes

To prevent content duplication, it may be useful to include code examples or other
MDX files inside the current page. To do it use `(\! path-to-file.mdx \!)` syntax (remove
backslashes in actual code).

Paths are resolved from the root of the repository.

Includes will only work in these two cases:

1. Include surrounded by newlines. E. g.:

   ```md
   Some text.

   (\! include.mdx \!)

   Some other text.
   ```

   If the include is an `mdx` file, it will be parsed and rendered as a markdown. In other cases 
   it will be included as-is.

2. Include inside the code blocks. E. g.:

   ````md
   ```bash
   # Code example below

   (\! include.sh \!)

   ```
   ````

   These will be inserted as-is, even in the case of the `mdx` files.

Includes in any other places will not be resolved and will be left as is.

Includes will be linted on CI. If the file didn't exist in the repository,
it would cause an error. Wrong placement of includes will also cause errors.

### Image pixel density marker

The browser can't distinguish between retina-ready and not retina-ready images.
Because of this, screenshots made on the retina screens may look large on the page.

To hint to the browser that the images are meant for retina display, we can add
the suffix `@Nx` to the image's file name. For example, screenshots made on macOS
should have the suffix `filename@2x.png`. It will tell the browser to scale images
down twice to show them in their actual size. Different OSes may require different
suffixes based on which logical and physical resolutions their screens have. 

### Admonitons

<Admonition title="Admontion title" type="tip">
 Admontion content.
</Admonition>

If you want to add admonition like the one above to the page use this syntax:

```jsx
<Admonition title="Admontion title" type="tip">
 Admontion content.
</Admonition>
```

`type` can be one of the following values: `warning`, `tip`, `note`, `danger`. 
Different types will result in different colors for the header. Omitting the type
or using some other value will result in resetting it to the `tip`.

If `title` is omitted, `type` will be used instead as the title value.

### Tabs

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="First label">
    First tab.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Second label">
    Second tab.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

To inser tabs block like the one above use this syntax:

```jsx
<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="First label">
    First tab.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Second label">
    Second tab.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```
