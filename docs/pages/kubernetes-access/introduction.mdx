description: Teleport Kubernetes access introduction, demo, and resources.

Teleport provides secure access to Kubernetes clusters.

- Users can receive short-lived kubeconfig files (and certificates) using Single Sign-On (SSO) and switch between clusters without logging in twice.
- Admins can use roles to implement policies, such as the best practice that developers must not access production.
- Organizations can achieve compliance by capturing `kubectl` events and session recordings for `kubectl`.

## SSO and Audit for Kubernetes Clusters

Set up SSO, capture audit events, and sessions with Teleport running in a Kubernetes cluster.
