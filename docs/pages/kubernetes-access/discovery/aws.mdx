title: Teleport EKS Auto-Discovery (Preview)
description: Auto-Discovery of EKS clusters in AWS cloud.
---

Similarly to [AKS Auto-Discovery](./azure.mdx), EKS Auto-Discovery can automatically 
discover any EKS cluster and enroll it in Teleport if its tags match the 
configured labels. 

(!docs/pages/kubernetes-access/discovery/includes/step-description.mdx!)

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- An AWS account with permissions to create and attach IAM policies.
- An AWS account with `system:masters` RBAC access to EKS clusters.
- A host to run the Teleport Discovery and Kubernetes services.
- One or more EKS clusters running. 

## Known limitations

Due to the authorization method that AWS has chosen for EKS clusters, it is not 
possible for the Teleport process to configure the necessary permissions to forward 
requests to EKS clusters.
This limitation exists because the authorization method on EKS clusters requires that the IAM role -
used for authentication - exists in the 
[`aws-auth`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/add-user-role.html) `ConfigMap`. 
In this `ConfigMap``, IAM roles are mapped to Kubernetes RBAC users or groups that are then 
used by Kubernetes RBAC to grant access permissions. If the mapping does not exist, it results in 
unauthorized requests. Therefore, Teleport cannot edit the `ConfigMap`
without first having access to the cluster.

If Teleport is not running with the same IAM identity that creates all clusters, 
please ensure you configure the required permissions as described in Step 2. 

## Step 1/3. Set up AWS IAM credentials

For Teleport to discover EKS clusters, the instance
running the Discovery Service requires an IAM policy that allows Teleport to list and 
describe EKS clusters:

```js
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "eks:DescribeCluster",
                "eks:ListClusters"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}      
```

## Step 2/3. Configure EKS cluster authorization


When the Kubernetes Service uses an IAM role that is different from the one that 
creates the clusters, you need to edit the `aws-auth` `Configmap` and append the 
mapping between the Teleport IAM role and the RBAC permissions on each of the 
discovered clusters. 

For simplicity, it is possible to map the Teleport IAM role into an existing 
Kubernetes RBAC group such as `system:masters`, but Teleport recommends setting 
up a separate Kubernetes RBAC group with the minimum required permissions.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Minimum RBAC permissions (recommended)" >

Connect to your target cluster with your credentials and create the following 
resources using `kubectl`.

### ClusterRole

Create the `ClusterRole` RBAC definition with the required permissions for Teleport 
Kubernetes Service to forward requests to the cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: teleport
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - ""
  resources:
  - users
  - groups
  - serviceaccounts
  verbs:
  - impersonate
- apiGroups:
  - ""
  resources:
  - pods
  verbs:
  - get
- apiGroups:
  - "authorization.k8s.io"
  resources:
  - selfsubjectaccessreviews
  - selfsubjectrulesreviews
  verbs:
  - create
```

### ClusterRoleBinding

Link the previously created `ClusterRole` into a `teleport` RBAC group.

```yaml
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: teleport
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: teleport
subjects:
- kind: Group
  name: teleport
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

### IAM mapping

Finally, edit the `configmap/aws-auth` in the `kube-system` namespace and append 
the following to `mapRoles`. Please replace `{teleport_aws_iam_role}` with the 
appropriate IAM role that Teleport Kubernetes Service will use. This step will 
link the Teleport IAM role into the Kubernetes RBAC group `teleport`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  mapRoles: |
    - groups:
      - teleport
      rolearn: {teleport_aws_iam_role} # e.g. arn:aws:iam::222222222222:role/teleport-role
      username: teleport
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="system:masters permissions" >
    <Notice type="warning">
Granting the `system:masters` group to the IAM role associated with the Teleport 
service means granting administrator-level permissions on the Kubernetes cluster.
  </Notice>

To associate the Teleport IAM role into the `system:masters` RBAC group, 
please edit the `configmap/aws-auth` in the `kube-system` namespace and append 
the following to `mapRoles`. 

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  mapRoles: |
  ...
    - groups:
      - system:masters
      rolearn: {teleport_aws_iam_role} # e.g. arn:aws:iam::222222222222:role/teleport-role
      username: teleport
```

Please replace `{teleport_aws_iam_role}` with the appropriate IAM role that 
Teleport Kubernetes Service is using.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

At this point, the Teleport IAM role already has the minimum permissions 
to forward requests to the cluster. 


## Step 3/3. Configure Teleport to discover EKS clusters

Teleport EKS Auto-Discovery requires a valid auth token for the Discovery and 
Kubernetes services to join the cluster. Generate one by running the following 
command against your Teleport Auth Service and save it in `/tmp/token` on the 
machine that will run Kubernetes Auto-Discovery:

```code
$ tctl tokens add --type=discovery,kube
```

Enabling EKS Auto-Discovery requires that the `discovery_service.aws` section 
include at least one entry and that `discovery_service.aws.types` include `eks`. 
It also requires configuring the `kubernetes_service.resources.tags` to use the same 
labels configured at `discovery_service.aws.tags` or a subset of them to make 
the Kubernetes Service listen to the dynamic resources created by the Discovery 
Service.

```yaml
version: v2
teleport:
  join_params:
    token_name: "/tmp/token"
    method: token
  auth_servers:
  - "teleport.example.com:3080"
auth_service:
  enabled: off
proxy_service:
  enabled: off
ssh_service:
  enabled: off
discovery_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  aws:
   - types: ["eks"]
     regions: ["eu-central-1"]
     tags:
       "env": "prod" # Match EKS cluster tags where tag:env=prod
kubernetes_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  resources:
  - labels:
      "env": "prod" # Match Kubernetes Cluster labels specified earlier
```

Once you have added this configuration, start Teleport. EKS clusters matching the tags and regions
specified in the AWS section will be added to the Teleport cluster automatically.
