As mentioned in [Kubernetes Auto-Discovery](../../discovery.mdx), the discovery process 
requires two separate Teleport components. The first, the Discovery Service, is 
responsible for watching the cloud provider and checking if there are any 
new clusters or if there have been any modifications to previously discovered clusters. 
The second, the Kubernetes Service, monitors the clusters created by the Discovery and 
is responsible for authenticating and forwarding the requests into them.

<Notice type="tip">

This guide presents the Discovery and Kubernetes services running in 
the same process, however both can run independently and on different machines. To do 
that, you just need to create a valid token for each of the roles and separate their 
configurations. Running the processes independently is beneficial if access 
to different clusters requires Kubernetes Service to be on the same network as 
the cluster.
