## Which database protocols does Teleport Database Access support?

Teleport Database Access currently supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB
protocols.

For PostgreSQL and MySQL, the following Cloud-hosted versions are supported in addition to self-hosted deployments:

- Amazon RDS
- Amazon Aurora (except for Amazon Aurora Serverless, which doesn't support IAM authentication)
- Amazon Redshift
- Google Cloud SQL
- Azure Database

See the available [guides](./guides.mdx) for all supported configurations.

## Which PostgreSQL protocol features are not supported?

The following PostgreSQL protocol features aren't currently supported:

- [Canceling requests in progress](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/protocol-flow.html#id-1.10.5.7.9).
  Cancel requests issued by the PostgreSQL clients connected to the Teleport
  Proxy Service won't be passed to the database server.
- Any [authentication methods](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-methods.html)
  except for client certificate authentication and IAM authentication for cloud
  databases.

## Can database clients use a public address different from the web public address?

<TabItem scope={["oss", "enterprise"]} label="Self-Hosted">

When configuring the Teleport Proxy Service, administrators can set the
`postgres_public_addr` and `mysql_public_addr` configuration fields to public
addresses over which respective database clients should connect. See
[Proxy Configuration](./reference/configuration.mdx#proxy-configuration) for
more details.

This is useful when the Teleport Web UI is running behind an L7 load balancer
(e.g. ALB in AWS), in which case the PostgreSQL/MySQL proxy needs to be exposed
on a plain TCP load balancer (e.g. NLB in AWS).

<TabItem scope={["cloud"]} label="Teleport Cloud">

In Teleport Cloud, the Proxy Service uses the following ports for
Database Access client traffic:

|Configuration setting|Port|
|---|---|
|`mysql_public_addr`|`3036`|
|`postgres_public_addr`|`443`|
|`mongo_public_addr`|`443`|

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Do you support X database client?

Teleport relies on client certificates for authentication, so any database
client that supports this method of authentication and uses modern TLS (1.2+)
should work.

Standard command-line clients such as `psql`, `mysql`, `mongo` or `mongosh` are
supported. There are also instructions for configuring select
[graphical clients](./guides/gui-clients.mdx).

## When will you support X database?

We plan to support more databases in the future based on customer demand.

See if the database you're interested in has already been requested among
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/labels/database-access)
or open a [new issue](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/new/choose)
to register your interest.
