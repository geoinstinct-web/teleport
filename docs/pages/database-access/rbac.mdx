These guides cover configuring access control policies for database users.

Read the [RBAC](./rbac/configuring-access.mdx) guide to get a general understanding
of how to configure Teleport roles to grant or deny access to your database users.

The [Automatic User Provisioning](./rbac/configuring-auto-user-provisioning.mdx)
guide explains how to get Teleport to create accounts for your PostgreSQL users
on-demand.
