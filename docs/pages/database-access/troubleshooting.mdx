Common issues and resolution steps.

## Connection attempts fail

### Certificate expired or is not yet valid

Attempts to connect to the database fail, and the error message returned is
similar to: **"Database service could not validate databaseâ€™s certificate:
certificate expired."**.

**Solution:** Renew the database certificate.

The Teleport Database Service uses a Teleport-issued certificate to authenticate
with the Database. This error happens when Teleport cannot authenticate, often
due to expired certificates.

The command used to generate a new certificate is `tctl auth sign`. For example,
to create a certificate for PostgreSQL, the command looks like this:
```bash
# Export Teleport's certificate authority and a generate certificate/key pair
# for host db.example.com with a 1-year validity period.

$ tctl auth sign --format=db --host=db.example.com --out=server --ttl=2190h
```

Each database uses a different format. You can check your database guide for more
details and examples:

- [PostgreSQL](./guides/postgres-self-hosted.mdx#step-25-create-a-certificatekey-pair)
- [MySQL/MariaDB](./guides/mysql-self-hosted.mdx#step-24-create-a-certificatekey-pair)
- [MongoDB](./guides/mongodb-self-hosted.mdx#set-up-mutual-tls)
- [CockroachDB](./guides/cockroachdb-self-hosted.mdx#set-up-mutual-tls)
- [Redis](./guides/redis.mdx#step-45-set-up-mutual-tls)
- [Redis Cluster](./guides/redis-cluster.mdx#step-46-set-up-mutual-tls)

After the new certificate is issued, update your database to make it take effect.
