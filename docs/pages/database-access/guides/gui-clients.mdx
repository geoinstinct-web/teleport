# Graphical Database Clients

This article describes how to configure popular graphical database clients to
work with Teleport Database Access.

## Obtain local certificate/key-pair

Issue the following command after you login with `tsh`:

```bash
# View configuration for the database you're logged in to.
tsh db config
# View configuration for the specific database when you're logged into multiple.
tsh db config example
```

It will display the path to your locally cached PEM files:

```
Name:      example
Host:      teleport.example.com
Port:      3036
User:      alice
Database:
CA:        /Users/alice/.tsh/keys/teleport.example.com/certs.pem
Cert:      /Users/alice/.tsh/keys/teleport.example.com/alice-db/root/example-x509.pem
Key:       /Users/alice/.tsh/keys/teleport.example.com/alice
```

The displayed `CA`, `Cert`, and `Key` files are used to connect through pgAdmin
4, MySQL Workbench, and other graphical database clients that support mutual
TLS authentication.

## pgAdmin 4

[pgAdmin 4](https://www.pgadmin.org/) is a popular graphical client for
PostgreSQL servers.

To configure a new connection, right-click on "Servers" in the main browser view
and create a new server:

![pgAdmin Add Server](../../../img/database-access/pgadmin-add-server@2x.png)

In the "General" tab of the new server dialog, enter the server connection name:

![pgAdmin General](../../../img/database-access/pgadmin-general@2x.png)

In the "Connection" tab, enter the default database name (the *maintenance
database*) and the connection service name (the same one that you specify when
connecting through `psql`). Leave all the other fields blank:

![pgAdmin Connection](../../../img/database-access/pgadmin-connection@2x.png)

In the "SSL" tab, set "SSL Mode" to `Verify-Full`:

![pgAdmin SSL](../../../img/database-access/pgadmin-ssl@2x.png)

Click "Save", and pgAdmin should immediately connect.

## MySQL Workbench

[MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) is a visual tool
that provides comprehensive MySQL administration and SQL development tools.

In MySQL Workbench "Setup New Connection" dialog, fill out "Connection Name",
"Hostname", "Port", and "Username":

![MySQL Workbench
Parameters](../../../img/database-access/workbench-parameters@2x.png)

In the "SSL" tab, set "Use SSL" to `Require and Verify Identity` and enter paths
to  your CA, certificate, and private key files from `tsh db config` command:

![MySQL Workbench SSL](../../../img/database-access/workbench-ssl@2x.png)

Optionally, click "Test Connection" to verify connectivity:

![MySQL Workbench Test](../../../img/database-access/workbench-test@2x.png)

Save the connection, and connect to the database.
