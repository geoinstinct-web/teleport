# AWS RDS/Aurora MySQL

## Enable IAM authentication

Teleport Database Access for AWS RDS and Aurora uses IAM authentication which
can be enabled with the following steps.

Open [Amazon RDS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/) and create a new
database instance with IAM authentication enabled, or modify an existing one to
turn it on. Make sure to use MySQL database type.

<Admonition type="note"  title="Aurora Serverless">
  Aurora Serverless does not support IAM authentication at the time of this
  writing so it can't be used with Database Access.
</Admonition>

See [Enabling and disabling IAM database authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.Enabling.html)
for more information.

## Create IAM policy

To allow Teleport database service to log into the database instance using auth
token, create an IAM policy and attach it to the user whose credentials the
database service will be using. For example:

```json
{
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
      {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
             "rds-db:connect"
         ],
         "Resource": [
             "arn:aws:rds-db:us-east-2:1234567890:dbuser:cluster-ABCDEFGHIJKL01234/*"
         ]
      }
   ]
}
```

The resource ARN in the policy has the following format:

```
arn:aws:rds-db:<region>:<account-id>:dbuser:<db-cluster-resource-id>/<db-user-name>
```

Parameters:

- `region`: AWS region where the database cluster is deployed.
- `account-id`: AWS account ID the database cluster is deployed under.
- `db-cluster-resource-id`: identifier for the database cluster, can be found
  under Configuration section in the RDS control panel.
- `db-user-name`: name of the database account to associate with IAM
  authentication. Can be a wildcard.

See [Creating and using an IAM policy for IAM database access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.IAMPolicy.html)
for more information.

## Create database user

Database accounts must have IAM authentication enabled in order to be allowed
access. For MySQL:

```sql
CREATE USER alice IDENTIFIED WITH AWSAuthenticationPlugin AS 'RDS';
```

By default the created user may not have access to anything and won't be able
to connect so let's grant it some permissions:

```sql
GRANT ALL ON `%`.* TO 'alice'@'%';
```

See [Creating a database account using IAM authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.DBAccounts.html)
for more information.

## Setup Teleport Auth and Proxy services

Teleport Database Access for MySQL on AWS is available starting from `6.0`
release.

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/start-auth-proxy.mdx!)

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/token.mdx!)

### Create role and user

Create the role that will allow a user to connect to any database using any
database account:

```bash
$ tctl --config=/path/to/teleport.yaml create <<EOF
kind: role
version: v3
metadata:
  name: db
spec:
  allow:
    db_labels:
      '*': '*'
    db_names:
    - '*'
    db_users:
    - '*'
EOF
```

Create the user assigned the `db` role we've just created:

```code
$ tctl --config=/path/to/teleport.yaml users add --roles=admin,db testuser
```

### Start Database service with CLI flags

For a quick try-out, Teleport database service doesn't require a configuration
file and can be launched using a single CLI command:

```code
$ teleport db start \
   --token=/tmp/token \
   --auth-server=teleport.example.com:3080 \
   --name=aurora \
   --protocol=mysql \
   --uri=mysql-aurora-instance-1.xxx.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:3306 \
   --aws-region=us-east-1 \
   --labels=env=dev
```

Note that the `--auth-server` flag must point to the Teleport cluster's proxy endpoint
because the database service always connects back to the cluster over a reverse
tunnel.

### Start Database service with config file

Below is an example of a database service configuration file that proxies
a single AWS Aurora MySQL database:

```yaml
teleport:
  # The data_dir should be a different location if running on the same
  # machine as Teleport auth and proxy.
  data_dir: /var/lib/teleport-db
  nodename: teleport-db-instance
  # Teleport invitation token used to join a cluster.
  # can also be passed on start using --token flag
  auth_token: /tmp/token
  # Proxy address to connect to. Note that it has to be the proxy address
  # because database service always connects to the cluster over reverse
  # tunnel.
  auth_servers:
  - teleport.example.com:3080
db_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  # This section contains definitions of all databases proxied by this
  # service, can contain multiple items.
  databases:
    # Name of the database proxy instance, used to reference in CLI.
  - name: "aurora"
    # Free-form description of the database proxy instance.
    description: "AWS Aurora MySQL"
    # Database protocol.
    protocol: "mysql"
    # Database address, example of a AWS Aurora endpoint in this case.
    uri: "mysql-aurora-instance-1.xxx.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:3306"
    # AWS specific configuration, only required for RDS and Aurora.
    aws:
      # Region the database is deployed in.
      region: us-east-1
    # Labels to assign to the database, used in RBAC.
    static_labels:
      env: dev
auth_service:
  enabled: "no"
ssh_service:
  enabled: "no"
proxy_service:
  enabled: "no"
```

<Admonition
  type="tip"
  title="Tip"
>
  A single Teleport process can run multiple different services, for example
  multiple database access proxies as well as running other services such an
  SSH service or an application access proxy.
</Admonition>

Start the database service:

```code
$ teleport start --config=/path/to/teleport-db.yaml --token=/tmp/token
```

### AWS credentials

When setting up Teleport database service with AWS RDS or Aurora, it must have
an IAM role allowing it to connect to that particular database instance. An
example of such a policy is shown in the [Create IAM Policy](#create-iam-policy)
section above. See [Creating and using an IAM policy for IAM database access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.IAMPolicy.html)
in AWS documentation.

Teleport database service uses the default credential provider chain to find AWS
credentials. See [Specifying Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/configuring-sdk.html#specifying-credentials)
for more information.

## Connect

Once the database service has joined the cluster, login to see the available
databases:

```code
$ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=testuser
$ tsh db ls
# Name   Description      Labels
# ------ ---------------- --------
# aurora AWS Aurora MySQL env=dev
```

Note that you will only be able to see databases your role has access to. See
[RBAC](../rbac.mdx) section for more details.

To connect to a particular database server, first retrieve credentials from
Teleport using `tsh db login` command:

```code
$ tsh db login aurora
```

<Admonition
  type="tip"
  title="Tip"
>
  You can be logged into multiple databases simultaneously.
</Admonition>

You can optionally specify the database name and the user to use by default
when connecting to the database instance:

```code
$ tsh db login --db-user=root --db-name=mysql aurora
```

Once logged in, connect to the database:

```code
$ tsh db connect aurora
```

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">
  The `mysql` command-line client should be available in PATH in order to be
  able to connect.
</Admonition>

If you would like to see the native `mysql` shell connect command, run:

```code
$ tsh db config --format=cmd aurora
```

To log out of the database and remove credentials:

```code
# Remove credentials for a particular database instance.
$ tsh db logout aurora
# Remove credentials for all database instances.
$ tsh db logout
```
