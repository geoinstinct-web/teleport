# Database Access High Availability (HA)

You can deploy Database Access in a Highly Available (HA) configuration in a
couple of common ways: combined replicas and separate replicas. Both of those
revolve around pointing multiple Database Services to the same database
instance.

## Combined replicas

The most common approach is to assign the same `name` to each Database Service
proxying the database.

If you have two Database Services proxying the same database, configuration for
both agents would be identical:

```yaml
# Same config for both agents.
db_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  databases:
  - name: "postgres"
    protocol: "postgres"
    uri: "postgres.example.com:5432"
```

With this configuration, you will see only a single entry for the database in
`tsh db ls`:

```code
$ tsh db ls
# Name
# --------
# postgres

$ tsh db login postgres
$ tsh db connect postgres
```

When connecting, Teleport will randomly pick the service to connect through to
provide some load balancing. If the selected agent is down (e.g. in case of AZ
outage), Teleport will try to connect via other agents.

## Separate replicas

With separate replicas, each Database Service agent proxying the database
assigns it a different name. This allows you to explicitly pick the agent
you want to connect to the database over:

```yaml
# Database service agent #1.
db_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  databases:
  # Note the name is different than agent #2 but URI is the same.
  - name: "postgres-us-east-1a"
    protocol: "postgres"
    uri: "postgres.example.com:5432"
```

```yaml
# Database service agent #2.
db_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  databases:
  # Note the name is different than agent #1 but URI is the same.
  - name: "postgres-us-east-1b"
    protocol: "postgres"
    uri: "postgres.example.com:5432"
```

With this configuration, both services will appear as two separate entries in
`tsh db ls` output and you will have to pick one explicitly when connecting:

```code
$ tsh db ls
# Name
# -------------------
# postgres-us-east-1a
# postgres-us-east-1b

$ tsh db login postgres-us-east-1a
$ tsh db connect postgres-us-east-1a
```

This approach is useful when you want to have control over which replica
you're using to connect.
