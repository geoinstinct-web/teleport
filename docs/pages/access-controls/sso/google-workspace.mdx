title: Teleport Authentication with Google Workspace (G Suite)
description: How to configure Teleport access with Google Workspace (formerly known as G Suite)
videoBanner: WTLWc6nnPfk
---

This guide explains how to configure [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/)
to be a single sign-on (SSO) provider that issues Teleport credentials to specific
groups of users. When you use Google Workspace in combination with Teleport role-based 
access control (RBAC), you can define policies like the following:

- Only members of the "DBA" Google group can connect to PostgreSQL databases.
- Developers must never SSH into production servers.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, verify the following:

- You have a Google Workspace super administrator account. 
   As a best practice, you should set up a separate account that requires multifactor 
   authentication to perform administrative actions. In most cases, you should avoid 
   granting your own sign-in user account elevated administrative privileges.
- You can sign up for Google Cloud and create a Google Cloud project. 
   Note that this guide doesn't require using any paid Google Cloud services.
- You can set up Google Workspace groups.
- You have a Teleport role with permission to maintain `oidc` resources. 
   This permission is available in the default `editor` role.

## Step 1/4. Configure Google Workspace

The following steps are required to configure Google Workspace to work with Teleport:

- Review your Google Workspace edition to determine how it integrates with Teleport.
- Create a new project on the Google Cloud Platform.
- Configure OAuth consent for the new project.
- Enable the required APIs.
- Create an OAuth client ID to allow Google Workspace users to log in to your Teleport cluster.
- Create a service account for Teleport to access additional Google Groups information.

### Review your Google Workspace edition

Google Workspace is available in multiple editions with different features and capabilities
for individuals and organizations. Because of differences between Google Workspace editions,
there are fundamental differences in how Teleport integrates with Google Workspace depending on
the Google Workspace edition you use. 

The key property that Teleport relies on to support Google Workspace is **transitive group membership**.
With transitive group membership, a user be a member of one group by virtue of being in another group. 
For example, if there is a child group nested within a parent group, every member of the child group is also
a member of the parent group.

#### Google Workspace editions and API

Google Workspace service accounts can determine whether a user has a transitive
membership in a specific group by calling methods in the Google Workspace
**Cloud Identity API**. These API methods are only usable for users belonging to
specific Google Workspace editions.

The Google Workspace **Directory API** allows administrators to list users and
groups in their Google Workspace domain, but does not enable them to query
transitive group memberships. The Directory API is available for all Google
Workspace editions.

#### How Teleport uses Google Workspace APIs

The Teleport OIDC connector uses the Google Workspace APIs to map users in Teleport 
roles to the Google Workspace groups they belong to.

To list a user's Google Workspace groups, Teleport first attempts to
get credentials by calling Cloud Identity API methods. If successful, Teleport uses 
the credentials to query a user's transitive group memberships.

If the credentials don't exist, Teleport gets credentials by calling 
Directory API methods. Teleport then uses the Directory API to list the 
user's groups in the entire Google Workspace for your organization. 
Groups that the user belongs to that are external to the workspace aren't listed.

#### How to check your current edition

To determine whether your Google Workspace edition supports querying transitive
group memberships:

1. Open [Inspect Groups](https://admin.google.com/ac/groupsinspection)
in the Google Workspace Admin Console. 
   
   Group inspection relies on the Cloud Identity API. 
   
1. Select **List all groups for a member** and **Include external groups**.
   
   If your Google Workspace edition supports the Cloud Identity API, you should
   block access to external groups at the workspace level as described in [Allow or block
   access to external groups](https://support.google.com/a/answer/9468710). Otherwise, membership 
   in any group external to the workspace will prevent users from signing in.
   
   If your Google Workspace edition doesn't support the Cloud Identity API, you must
   ensure that your role-based access controls don't depend on transitive group memberships.

### Create a new project

To create a new project:

1. Open the Google Cloud console.

1. Click **Enabled APIs and services**, then click [**Create project**](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/apis/dashboard).

1. Type a Project name and select an organization and a location for the project, then click **Create**.

### Configure OAuth consent

To configure OAuth consent for the new project:

1. In the Google Cloud console left sidebar, click [**OAuth consent screen**](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent).

1. Select **Internal** as the User Type, then click **Create**.

   ![configuration of the OAuth consent screen](../../../img/sso/googleoidc/consent-screen-1.png)

1. Configure your connector by typing an application name, selecting a user or group to receive email messages 
from users about their OAuth consent, and setting other application options.

1. Click **Save and continue**.

1. Click on **Add or remove scopes**.

1. Select the `.../auth/userinfo.email` and `openid` scopes, then click **Update**..

   ![select email and openid scopes](../../../img/sso/googleoidc/consent-screen-2.png)

1. Click **Save and continue**.

1. Review the information on the Summary page, then click **Back to dashboard**.

### Enable the required APIs

To enable required APIs:

1. Select [Cloud Identity API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/cloudidentity.googleapis.com) 
in the API Library, then click **Enable** to support transitive group membership.

1. Select [Admin SDK API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/admin.googleapis.com)
in the API Library, then click **Enable** to support direct group membership. 

You can enable one or both API libraries.
However, your Google Workspace edition must support the API you choose to use.
Consult the documentation for the API library to ensure that you have a
supported Google Workspace edition.

### Create an OAuth client ID

To create an OAuth client identifier:

1. In the Google Cloud console left sidebar, click **Credentials**.

1. Click **Create credentials**, then seelect **OAuth client ID**:

   ![Create an OAuth Client ID](../../../img/sso/googleoidc/create-oauth-client-id.png)

1. Select **Web application** as the Application type, and type a name for the application.

1. Under Authorized redirect URIs, click Add URI.

1. Set the redirect URI to the address of your Teleport Proxy Service or Teleport cloud tenant, then
add `/v1/webapi/oidc/callback` to the URI.
   
   ![OAuth client ID creation](../../../img/sso/googleoidc/clientid-creation.png)

1. Copy the Client ID and Client secret from the OAuth client created or click **Download JSON**:

   ![OAuth client data](../../../img/sso/googleoidc/clientid-data.png)

   If you choose to save the client identifier and client secret by clicking **Download JSON**, 
   be aware that this JSON file isn't the one used to handle the credentials for authentication.
   A second JSON file is generated when you create the service account for the OAuth client.

1. Click **OK**.

### Create a service account

To create a service account:

1. In the Google Cloud console for your project, expand **IAM & Admin**, then select **Service Accounts**. 

1. Click [**Create service account**](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/create):

   ![Create a service account](../../../img/sso/googleoidc/create-service-account.png)

1. Type a name for your service account and, optionally, a description of what the service account is for.
   
   ![service account creation](../../../img/sso/googleoidc/serviceacct-creation.png)

1. Click **Create and continue**, then click **Done**.

1. Click the newly-created account to view its details, and copy its Unique ID for later.

   ![service account unique ID](../../../img/sso/googleoidc/serviceacct-uniqueid.png)

1. Click **Keys**, click **Add key**, and select **Create new key** to create keys for the service account.

   ![service account key creation](../../../img/sso/googleoidc/serviceacct-key.png)

1. Select JSON as the Key type, then click **Create**.
   
   Google Cloud automatically downloads a JSON file with the keys for the service account 
   similar to the following:

   ```code
   {
      "type": "service_account",
      "project_id": "teleport-project-xxxxxx",
      "private_key_id": "f06exxxxxxxxxxxxxxxdc18",
      "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n0000000000000w==\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
      "client_email": "gwsso@teleport-project-xxxxxx.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
      "client_id": "11xxxxxxxxxxxxx89",
      "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
      "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
      "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
      "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/gwsso%40teleport-project-xxxxxx.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
      "universe_domain": "googleapis.com"
    }
    ```

   This file is used in a later step to configure the OIDC connector for the Teleport Auth Service to use, 
   either by referencing a local file on the host running the Teleport Auth Service or including the contents 
   in the command line to create the connector resource.
   
### Configure domain-wide delegation

Now that you have a service account for Teleport to use, you can configure 
[domain-wide delegation](https://admin.google.com/ac/owl/domainwidedelegation) for the
service account.

To configure delegation:

1. Open the Google Workspace Admin console and navigate to 
[Manage domain-wide delegation](https://admin.google.com/ac/owl/domainwidedelegation).

1. Click **Add new**.

1. Paste the numeric Unique ID that you' copied from the service account:

   ![domain-wide delegation](../../../img/sso/googleoidc/domainwidedelegation.png)

1. Add **one** of the following scopes depending on your Google Workspace:
   
   - For direct and indirect groups (*transitive group membership support*), add:
      `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-identity.groups.readonly`
   - For direct groups only, add:
      `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group.readonly`

1. Click **Authorize**.

## Step 2/4. Create an OIDC connector

After you have prepared your Google Workspace environment, you can create the OIDC
connector by running the `tctl sso configure oidc` command. Depending on how you have deployed
your Teleport cluster, you can create the OIDC connector resource in one of two ways:

- You can **embed** the service account information in the connector resource.
- You can **upload** the service account JSON file to hosts running the Teleport Auth Service.

The service account JSON must be available to **all Teleport Auth Service hosts** if you 
deploy Teleport as a high availability cluster. In most cases, you should use the 
**embedded JSON** method to create the connector in high availability and cloud deployments to avoid 
storing credentials in a file on multiple servers.

The alternative to creating the OIDC connector with embedded JSON is to upload the JSON file.
If you have a self-hosted Teleport cluster, you can upload the service account JSON file to all hosts 
running the Teleport Auth Service.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Embed JSON">

The following command defines the service account by embedding JSON in the command used to create the connector resource.
With this method, you don't have to provide the JSON file to all of the host(s) running the Teleport sAuth Service.

```code
$ tctl sso configure oidc --preset google --id <CLIENT-ID> \
--secret <CLIENT-SECRET> \
--claims-to-roles groups,auditor@example.com,auditor \
--claims-to-roles groups,teleport-developers@example.com,access \
--google-admin=<GOOGLE-WORKSPACE-ADMIN-EMAIL> \
--google-acc '
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "teleport-project-xxxxxx",
  "private_key_id": "f06exxxxxxxxxxxxxxxdc18",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n0000000000000w==\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": "gwsso@teleport-project-xxxxxx.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "client_id": "11xxxxxxxxxxxxx89",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/gwsso%40teleport-project-xxxxxx.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "universe_domain": "googleapis.com"
}'
```

After copying this command, be sure to remove the brackets (< >) and replace the placeholder strings with the 
appropriate information for your Google Workspace. For example, replace `<GOOGLE-WORKSPACE-ADMIN-EMAIL>` with 
`admin@yourdomain.com`.

This command creates a file similar to the following:

```yaml
kind: oidc
metadata:
  name: google
spec:
  claims_to_roles:
  - claim: groups
    roles:
    - auditor
    value: auditor@example.com
  - claim: groups
    roles:
    - access
    value: teleport-developers@example.com
  client_id: <CLIENT-ID>
  client_secret: <CLIENT-SECRET>
  display: Google
  google_admin_email: <GOOGLE-WORKSPACE-ADMIN-EMAIL>
  google_service_account: |2-

    {
      "type": "service_account",
      "project_id": "teleport-project-xxxxxx",
      "private_key_id": "f06exxxxxxxxxxxxxxxdc18",
      "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n0000000000000w==\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
      "client_email": "gwsso@teleport-project-xxxxxx.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
      "client_id": "11xxxxxxxxxxxxx89",
      "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
      "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
      "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
      "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/gwsso%40teleport-project-xxxxxx.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
      "universe_domain": "googleapis.com"
    }
  issuer_url: https://accounts.google.com
  redirect_url: https://example.teleport.sh:443/v1/webapi/oidc/callback
version: v3
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Upload JSON">

The following command uploads the JSON file to a host running the Teleport Auth Service.
You can use this method for self-hosted Teleport Auth Service instances if you can
make the JSON file available to all hosts running the Teleport Auth Service.

```code
$ tctl sso configure oidc --preset google --id <CLIENT-ID> \
--secret <CLIENT-SECRET> \
--google-acc-uri <PATH/TO/SERVICE-ACCOUNT-KEY>.json \
--claims-to-roles groups,auditor@example.com,auditor \
--claims-to-roles groups,teleport-developers@example.com,access \
--google-admin=<GOOGLE-WORKSPACE-ADMIN-EMAIL> > gworkspace-connector.yaml
```

After copying this command, be sure to remove the brackets (< >) and replace the placeholder strings with the 
appropriate information for your Google Workspace. For example, replace `<GOOGLE-WORKSPACE-ADMIN-EMAIL>` with 
`admin@yourdomain.com`.

This command creates a file similar to the following:

```yaml
kind: oidc
metadata:
  name: google
spec:
  claims_to_roles:
  - claim: groups
    roles:
    - auditor
    value: auditor@example.com
  - claim: groups
    roles:
    - access
    value: teleport-developers@example.com
  client_id: <CLIENT-ID>
  client_secret: <CLIENT-SECRET>
  display: Google
  google_admin_email: <GOOGLE-WORKSPACE-ADMIN-EMAIL>
  google_service_account_uri: /PATH/TO/SERVICE-ACCOUNT-KEY.json
  issuer_url: https://accounts.google.com
  redirect_url: https://teleport.example.com/v1/webapi/oidc/callback
version: v3
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The email that you set for `google_admin_email` **must** be the email address of
an account that has permission to list all groups, users, and group membership in
your Google Workspace organization. In general, this user account must have full 
administrative privileges or group administrative privileges.

Don't use the email of the service account for `google_admin_email`. The
configuration display will look the same, but the service account will not have
the required domain-wide delegation.

The `client_id` field must be the unique ID number captured from the Google Cloud
Platform UI. An indicator that this is misconfigured is if you see "invalid Google
Workspace credentials for scopes [...]" in your audit log, accessible from the
Auth service host or the **Management** section of the web UI.

Test the connector:

```code
$ cat gworkspace-connector.yaml | tctl sso test
```

This will open your browser and attempt to sign you in to your Teleport cluster
using Google. If it fails, the CLI output will provide useful troubleshooting
information.

Create the connector using the `tctl` tool:

```code
$ tctl create -f gworkspace-connector.yaml
```

## Step 3/4. Test your Google Workspace OIDC connector

After you create the connector, the Teleport Web UI displays a new sign-in option, **Login with Google**. 
To sign in from the command-line:

```code
$ tsh --proxy=proxy.example.com login --auth=google
```

This command displays the single sign-on endpoint URL and tries to open it
automatically in a browser.
