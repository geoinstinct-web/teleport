### Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/device-trust/prereqs.mdx!)

## Register a trusted device

To register a device, you first need to determine its serial number.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Self enrollment">
User's with `editor` role can register and enroll their device directly using `tsh` with
the following command:
```code
$ tsh device enroll --current-device
Device "(=devicetrust.asset_tag=)"/macOS registered and enrolled
```
</Admonition>

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="macOS">
    The serial number of a macOS device can be determined in two ways.

    Through the UI, visible under Apple -> "About This Mac" -> "Serial number".

    Through the terminal:
    ```code
    $ ioreg -c IOPlatformExpertDevice -d 2 | grep -i IOPlatformSerialNumber | awk -F'"' '{print $4}'
    (=devicetrust.asset_tag=)
    ```

    Replace <Var name="(=devicetrust.asset_tag=)" description="The serial number to be registered"/>
    with the serial number obtained from the device you wish to enroll and run `tctl devices add` command:

    ```code
    $ tctl devices add --os=macos --asset-tag="<Var name="(=devicetrust.asset_tag=)"/>"
    Device <Var name="(=devicetrust.asset_tag=)"/>/macos added to the inventory
    ```

    Use `tctl` to check that the device has been registered:

    ```code
    $ tctl devices ls
    Asset Tag    OS    Enroll Status Device ID
    ------------ ----- ------------- ------------------------------------
    (=devicetrust.asset_tag=) macOS not enrolled  (=devicetrust.device_id=)
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Windows">
    Windows devices can have multiple serial numbers depending on the configuration made by the manufacturer. Teleport will pick the first available value from the following:
    - System asset tag
    - System serial number
    - Baseboard serial number

    To find the value chosen by Teleport, run the following command:

    ```code
    $ tsh device collect
    DeviceCollectedData {
      ...
      "serial_number": "(=devicetrust.asset_tag=)",
      ...
    }
    ```

    Replace <Var name="(=devicetrust.asset_tag=)" description="The serial number to be registered"/>
    with the serial number obtained from the device you wish to enroll and run `tctl devices add` command:

    ```code
    $ tctl devices add --os=windows --asset-tag="<Var name="(=devicetrust.asset_tag=)"/>"
    Device <Var name="(=devicetrust.asset_tag=)"/>/windows added to the inventory
    ```

    Use `tctl` to check that the device has been registered:

    ```code
    $ tctl devices ls
    Asset Tag    OS    Enroll Status Device ID
    ------------ ----- ------------- ------------------------------------
    (=devicetrust.asset_tag=) windows not enrolled  (=devicetrust.device_id=)
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Admonition type="tip" title="Sync with Jamf">
Teleport supports device synchronization with [Jamf](./jamf-integration.mdx). Once configured, devices
are automatically updated in Teleport device inventory, avoiding manual device operation.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="warning" title="Device Role">
For clusters created using Teleport v12 or newer, the builtin role editor has the necessary permissions to manage devices.
If you Teleport cluster is older than v12, you will need to create and grant [`device` role](#dedicated-device-admin-role)
to manage device inventory.
</Admonition>

## Generate enrollment token
A registered device becomes a trusted device after it goes through the
enrollment ceremony. The tie between the device inventory and enrollment
is a device enrollment token. A device enrollment token needs to be created
by a device admin and sent to the person performing the enrollment ceremony.

The token ties the actual device being enrolled to the expected device in the
inventory, adding an extra layer of protection.

To create an enrollment token run the following command, where `--asset-tag` is
the serial number of the device we want to enroll.

```code
$ tctl devices enroll --asset-tag="(=devicetrust.asset_tag=)"
Run the command below on device "(=devicetrust.asset_tag=)" to enroll it:
tsh device enroll --token=(=devicetrust.enroll_token=)
```

## Enrolling device

To perform the enrollment ceremony, using the device specified above, type the
command printed by `tctl devices enroll`:

<Admonition type="note" title="tctl and tsh">
- `tctl` is used to manage device, i.e. register device, generate enrollment token, remove device.
- `tsh` is used to enroll device.
</Admonition>

```code
$ tsh device enroll --token=(=devicetrust.enroll_token=)
Device "(=devicetrust.asset_tag=)"/macOS enrolled

$ tsh logout
$ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=myuser # fetch new certificates
Enter password for Teleport user myuser:
Tap any security key
Detected security key tap
> Profile URL:        https://teleport.example.com:443
  Logged in as:       myuser
  Cluster:            teleport.example.com
  Roles:              access, editor
  Logins:             myuser
  Kubernetes:         enabled
  Valid until:        2023-06-23 02:47:05 -0300 -03 [valid for 12h0m0s]
  Extensions:         teleport-device-asset-tag, teleport-device-credential-id, teleport-device-id
```
The presence of the `teleport-device-*` extensions shows that the device was
successfully enrolled and authenticated. The device above is now a trusted device.

<Admonition type="note" title="Windows">
On Windows, the `tsh device enroll` command attempts to elevate to
administrator privileges on the device. Privilege elevation is required to
perform a TPM Credential Activation. This step is only required for
enrollment and is not required on future device authentications.
</Admonition>

## Auto enrollment
In a large organization, distributing enrollment token to user can be challenging.
Teleport supports auto-enrollment, which if enabled, automatically enrolls user
device during next Teleport login.

Auto-enrollment allows `tsh` to automatically enroll devices already registered
in Teleport during the user's login. The registration may be
[manual](./device-management.mdx#register-a-trusted-device) or performed using an
integration, like the [Jamf Pro integration](./jamf-integration.mdx).

<Admonition type="note" title="Device Registration">
A previously [registered device](#register-a-trusted-device) is necessary for
  auto-enrollment to take place.
</Admonition>

Enable auto-enrollment in your cluster settings:

<Tabs dropDownCaption="Teleport Deployment">
<TabItem label="Dynamic Resources" options="Self-Hosted,Teleport Enterprise Cloud" >
Modify the dynamic config resource using `tctl edit cluster_auth_preference`:

```diff
kind: cluster_auth_preference
version: v2
metadata:
  name: cluster-auth-preference
spec:
  # ...
  device_trust:
    mode: "required"
+   auto_enroll: true
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Static Config" options="Self-Hosted">
Edit the Auth Server's `teleport.yaml` file:

```diff
auth_service:
  authentication:
    # ...
    device_trust:
+     auto_enroll: true
```

After saving the changes, restart the Teleport service.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Login using a registered device.

Using a device previously registered in Teleport, logout and login again:

```code
$ tsh logout
All users logged out.
$ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=myuser
Enter password for Teleport user myuser:
Tap any security key
Detected security key tap
> Profile URL:        https://teleport.example.com:443
  Logged in as:       myuser
  Cluster:            teleport.example.com
  Roles:              access, editor
  Logins:             myuser
  Kubernetes:         enabled
  Valid until:        2023-06-23 02:47:05 -0300 -03 [valid for 12h0m0s]
  Extensions:         teleport-device-asset-tag, teleport-device-credential-id, teleport-device-id
```

The presence of the `teleport-device-*` extensions shows that the device was
successfully enrolled and authenticated.

## Removing trusted device

A device that is no longer in use may be removed using `tctl devices rm
--device-id=<ID>` or `tctl devices rm --asset-tag=<SERIAL>`.

First, find a device to delete:
```code
$ tctl devices ls
Asset Tag    OS    Enroll Status Device ID
------------ ----- ------------- ------------------------------------
C00AA0AAAA0A macOS enrolled      c9cbb327-68a8-497e-b820-6a4b2bf58269
```

Now use asset-tag or device id to delete a device:
```code
# delete with asset tag
$ tctl devices rm --asset-tag=C00AA0AAAA0A
Device "C00AA0AAAA0A" removed

# delete with device id
$ tctl devices rm --device-id=c9cbb327-68a8-497e-b820-6a4b2bf58269
Device "c9cbb327-68a8-497e-b820-6a4b2bf58269" removed
```

## Dedicated device admin role
For tighter control over enrollment process, we recommend creating a dedicated
device admin role and grant the role to user allowed for device management.

Following is an example of a role that grants permissions for the `device` resource is necessary to manage
the inventory. Save the yaml below as `device-admin.yaml` and create it in your
cluster:

```yaml
version: v6
kind: role
metadata:
  name: device-admin
spec:
  allow:
    rules:
    - resources: ["device"]
      verbs:
      - create
      - read
      - list
      - update
      - delete
      - create_enroll_token
      - enroll
```

```code
$ tctl create -f device-admin.yaml
role 'device-admin' has been created
```

Note that in addition to the usual CRUD verbs (create, read, list, update and
delete), we have also included `create_enroll_token` and `enroll`. The
`create_enroll_token` verb is necessary to execute the `tctl devices enroll`
command; `enroll` is necessary to execute `tsh device enroll`. Both are
demonstrated in the following section.


## Configuring a TPM EKCert CA allow-list

This advice only applies to Device Trust on platforms that use TPMs. For now,
this is just Windows.

Some TPMs include a certificate—known as an EKCert—signed by the
manufacturer's certificate authority (CA). This certificate allows a third party
(such a Teleport cluster) to know that the TPM it is communicating with is
legitimate. This significantly reduces the burden on the administrator to ensure
that the device has not been tampered with prior to enrollment.

By default, the Teleport cluster does not verify the EKCert. This is because
not all TPMs include an EKCert, and it is not possible to verify an EKCert
without knowledge of the manufacturer's CA. This verification is enabled by the
inclusion of the Teleport configuration field called `ekcert_allowed_cas`.

Once configured, only devices that include a TPM with an EKCert signed by a
CA specified in the field will be able to enroll. Previously-enrolled devices
will not be affected.

To configure `ekcert_allowed_cas`, you must first obtain the CA certificate in
PEM format from the manufacturer of the TPM included in your devices. This step
varies from manufacturer to manufacturer.

After you obtain the CA certificate in PEM format, there are two ways of
configuring `ekcert_allowed_cas`:

- Statically using the Teleport configuration file. This is the simplest
  option, but is not possible for Teleport Cloud clusters and not recommended
  for clusters in a highly available configuration.
- Dynamically using `cluster_auth_preference` resource. This works with all
  clusters and is the most flexible.

<Tabs dropDownCaption="Teleport Deployment">
<TabItem label="Dynamic Resources" options="Self-Hosted,Teleport Enterprise Cloud" >
Modify the dynamic config resource using `tctl edit cluster_auth_preference`:

```diff
kind: cluster_auth_preference
version: v2
metadata:
  name: cluster-auth-preference
spec:
  ...
  device_trust:
    mode: "required" # add this line
+    ekcert_allowed_cas:
+      # The CA is configured inline within the resource:
+      - |
+        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
+        --snip--
+        -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Static Config" options="Self-Hosted">
Edit the Auth Server's `teleport.yaml` file and restart:

```diff
auth_service:
  authentication:
    ...
    device_trust:
+      ekcert_allowed_cas:
+      # The CA can be configured inline within the configuration file:
+      - |
+        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
+        --snip--
+        -----END CERTIFICATE-----
+      # Or, it can be configured in the configuration file using a path:
+      - /path/to/my/ekcert-ca.pem
```
