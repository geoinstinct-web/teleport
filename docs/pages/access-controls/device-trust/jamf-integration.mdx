description: Sync your Jamf inventory into Teleport
---

Device Trust Jamf integration lets you automatically sync your Jamf computer
inventory into Teleport.

Jamf service is a distinct `teleport` process that periodically reads your
computer inventory from Jamf and syncs it to Teleport. It performs both
incremental (called "partial") and full syncs, as well as removals from Teleport
if a computer is removed from Jamf.

Syncing devices from Jamf is an **inventory management** step, equivalent to
automatically running the corresponding `tctl devices add` commands.

See the [Device Trust guide](./guide.mdx) for fundamental Device Trust concepts
and behavior.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/commercial-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

(!docs/pages/includes/device-trust/prereqs.mdx!)

## Step 1/4. Create a Jamf user

Create a readonly Jamf user for inventory sync.

1. Access https://yourtenant.jamfcloud.com/accounts.html, replacing "yourtenant"
   with your Jamf Pro account.

2. Create a new Standard Account with the following settings:

   - Username: teleport (change as desired)
   - Access Level: Full Access
   - Privilege Set: Custom
   - Access Status: Enabled
   - Password: (a strong password of your choice)
   - Privileges:
     - Advanced Computer Searches: Read
     - Computers: Read

   Take note of the user and password created here for the next step.

   Privileges setup: ![Jamf privileges setup](

## Step 2/4. Configure Jamf service

Jamf inventory sync is performed by a separate `teleport` process, configured
using the `jamf_service` key. It is recommended to run the service isolated from
other Teleport processes, as it requires the Jamf credentials created in the
step above.

Save the following file as `/var/lib/teleport.yaml` and edit as needed:

```yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  # Necessary to write devices back to Teleport.
  proxy_server: teleport.example.com:443 # CHANGEME

jamf_service:
  enabled: true
  name: jamf
  api_endpoint: https://yourtenant.jamfcloud.com # CHANGEME
  username: teleport                             # CHANGEME
  password_file: /var/lib/teleport/jamf_password.txt

auth_service:
  enabled: false

proxy_service:
  enabled: false

ssh_service:
  enabled: false
```

Change the following settings, as appropriate:

- teleport.proxy_server
- jamf_service.api_endpoint
- jamf_service.username

Finally, write your Jamf password to the `/var/lib/teleport/jamf_password` file:

```code
$ nano /var/lib/teleport/jamf_password # or use your favorite editor

# Only the OS user that runs `teleport` should have access to the password file.
$ chmod 400 /var/lib/teleport/jamf_password
$ chown teleport /var/lib/teleport/jamf_password
```

## Step 3/4. Create a join token

Jamf service requires an MDM token to write devices to Teleport.
Create the token as shown below:

```code
$ tctl tokens add --type=mdm
The invite token: 07c0565aa280595d7645b2964c36ebd1
This token will expire in 30 minutes.

Use this token to add an MDM service to Teleport.

> teleport start \
   --token=07c0565aa280595d7645b2964c36ebd1 \
   --ca-pin=sha256:4b32d9c54b2b3332019d5f0720b8f9a603de03ace07d308bcd743465eee1f200 \
   -c=/path/to/teleport.yaml
```

## Step 4/4. Start Jamf service

Using the token created above, start the service:

```code
$ teleport start -c /var/lib/teleport.yaml \
   --token=07c0565aa280595d7645b2964c36ebd1 \
   --ca-pin=sha256:4b32d9c54b2b3332019d5f0720b8f9a603de03ace07d308bcd743465eee1f200
```

The initial sync should happen in a few minutes:

```
2023-06-21T17:26:40-03:00 INFO [JAMF:1]    Jamf service successfully started pid:25757.1 service/service.go:228
2023-06-21T17:26:40-03:00 INFO [JAMF:1]    Starting sync CutTime:0001-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC FilterRSQL: Mode:1 OnMissing:DELETE pid:25757.1 service/service.go:261
2023-06-21T17:26:40-03:00 INFO [JAMF:1]    Device sync report, page #0 deletes:0 failures:0 pid:25757.1 upserts:1 service/service.go:666
2023-06-21T17:26:40-03:00 INFO [JAMF:1]    Sync complete pid:25757.1 service/service.go:277
```

Using the default configuration, the service will sync devices from Jamf every
few hours. Once a day a full inventory sync is performed, enumerating all
devices from Jamf and reflecting any additions or removals on Teleport.

After the initial sync happens, you may verify the synced devices using `tctl
devices ls`:

```code
$ tctl devices ls
Asset Tag    OS      Enroll Status Device ID
