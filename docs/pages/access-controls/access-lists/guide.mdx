This guide will help you:
- Create an access list
- Assign a member to it
- Verify permissions granted through the list membership

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/commercial-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- A running Teleport cluster with some built in resources. Following the
  [Web Application Access Guide](../../application-access/guides/connecting-apps.mdx) will create a base with a
  simple application that we can use to demonstrate access lists.
- An administrative user with the preset `editor` role, which will have permissions to create Access Lists.

## Step 1/3. Create a test user

First, we need to create a simple test user that has only the `requester` role, which has no default access
to anything within a cluster. This user will only be used for the purposes of this guide, so you may use
another user if you so choose.

```code
$ tctl users add test-user --roles=requester --logins=root,ubuntu,ec2-user
```

Then, follow the link provided and create credentials for this user. Try logging in to verify that no resources
are found.

## Step 2/3. Create an Access List

Next, we'll create a simple access list that will grant the `access` role to its members.
Login as the administrative user mentioned in the prerequisites. Navigate to the management pane and
click on access lists. Click on "Create an Access List."

![Navigate to create new Access List](../../../img/access-controls/access-lists/create-new-access-list.png)

Here, fill in a title, description, and grant the `access` role.

![Fill out Access List Fields](../../../img/access-controls/access-lists/fill-out-access-list-fields.png)

Under "List Owners" select `editor` as a required role, then add your administrative user under "Add
Eligible List Owners."

![Select an owner](../../../img/access-controls/access-lists/select-owner.png)

Under "Members" select `requester` as a required role, then add your test user to the access list.

![Add a member](../../../img/access-controls/access-lists/add-member.png)

We'll leave the the requirements fields blank and then click "Create Access List" at the bottom
of the page.

## Step 3/3. Login as the test user

Again, login as the test user. When logging in now, you should now see the resources contained within
the cluster, and should be able to interact with them as expected.

## Next Steps

- Familiarize yourself with the CLI tooling available for managing access lists in the [reference](./reference.mdx).
