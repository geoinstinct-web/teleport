h1: Teleport SAML IdP service provider RBAC
---

To manage access to SAML IdP service provider, a role spec must target `saml_idp_service_provider`
resource kind.

Currently, SAML IdP only supports role-based access to `saml_idp_service_provider` resource.
It does not support label-based resource filtering. User's can either have access to
all the registered SAML IdP service provider's or they don't.

This guide shows how to create roles that allow user's to access and manage SAML IdP protected
resource in Teleport.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/commercial-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- If you're new to SAML, consider reviewing our [SAML Identity Provider
  Reference](./saml-reference.mdx) before proceeding.
- User with permission to read and modify `saml_idp_service_provider` resource. The preset `editor`
role has this permission.



## SAML IdP access role

For non-administrative access to SAML IdP protected resources, a user should be assigned with
a role that has `list` and `read` verbs defined for `saml_idp_service_provider` resource.

Below is a reference role spec that enables accessing service provider's registered with Teleport
SAML IdP.

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: saml-app-access
spec:
  allow:
    rules:
    - resources:
      - saml_idp_service_provider
      verbs:
      - list
      - read
version: v7
```

Create the role with `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl create saml-app-access.yaml
role 'saml-app-access' has been created
```

Next, add the role to your user.

(!docs/pages/includes/add-role-to-user.mdx role="saml-app-access"!)


## SAML IdP administrative role

For administrative access to SAML IdP service provider, a user should be assigned with
a role that has `list`, `read`, `create`, `update` and `delete` verbs defined for
`saml_idp_service_provider` resource.

Below is a reference role spec that enables creating and managing service provider's with Teleport
SAML IdP.

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: saml-idp-manager
spec:
  allow:
    rules:
    - resources:
      - saml_idp_service_provider
      verbs:
      - list
      - create
      - read
      - update
      - delete
version: v7
```

Create the role with `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl create saml-idp-manager.yaml
role 'saml-idp-manager' has been created
```

Next, add the role to your user.
