Teleport Just-in-Time Access Requests allow users to receive temporary elevated
privileges by seeking consent from one or more reviewers, depending on your
configuration.

With Teleport's Access Request plugins, users can manage Access Requests from
within your organization's existing messaging and project management solutions.

## Architecture

Access Request plugins are self-contained programs that connect to the Teleport
Auth Service's gRPC API to listen for audit events relating to new or updated
Access Requests. After processing an Access Request event, Access Request plugins
interact with a third-party API (e.g., the Slack or PagerDuty APIs). 

Access Request plugins can run within private networks that are isolated from
the Teleport Auth Service. To access the Auth Service API, they connect to the
Proxy Service, which establishes a reverse tunnel for the plugin to access the
Auth Service.

You can run multiple instances of an Access Request plugin for high availability
by deploying each instance in a separate availability zone. There is no need for
additional configuration or load balancing, as plugins avoid creating duplicate
requests to their third-party APIs.

To read more about the architecture of an Access Request plugin, and start
writing your own, read our [Access Request plugin development
guide](../../api/access-plugin.mdx).
