title: Access Requests with ServiceNow
description: How to set up Teleport's ServiceNow plugin for privilege elevation approvals.
---

With Teleport's ServiceNow integration, engineers can access the infrastructure
they need to resolve incidents quickly, without granting longstanding admin permissions
that can become a vector for attacks.

Teleport's ServiceNow integration allows you to treat Teleport Access
Requests as ServiceNow incidents, notify the appropriate on-call team, and
approve or deny the requests via Teleport.

This guide will explain how to set up Teleport's Access Request plugin for
ServiceNow.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/commercial-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- An ServiceNow account with access to read and write to and from the 'incident' table.
- The ServiceNow integration is currently only available in Teleport Cloud.
- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/4. Create services

We will configure the ServiceNow plugin to create an incident when
certain users create an Access Request.

## Step 2/4. Define RBAC resources

The Teleport ServiceNow plugin works by receiving Access Request events from the
Teleport Auth Service and, based on these events, interacting with the ServiceNow
API.

Before making the access request ensure the user making the request has
the `requester` role.

## Step 3/4. Configure the ServiceNow plugin

At this point, you have a ServiceNow user that the ServiceNow plugin will use
to connect to the ServiceNow API. To configure the plugin to use this user navigate
to Management -> Integrations -> Enroll New Integration.

The plugin requires credentials that can read and write to the incident table.

## Step 4/4. Test the ServiceNow plugin

### Create an Access Request

As the Teleport user `myuser`, create an Access Request for the `editor` role:

In ServiceNow, you will see a new incident containing information about the
Access Request.

### Resolve the request
