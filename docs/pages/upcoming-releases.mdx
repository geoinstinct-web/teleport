The Teleport team delivers a new major release roughly every 4 months.

## Teleport

| Version | Date           |
| ------- | -------------- |
| 15.3.0  | April 30, 2024 |
| 16.0.0  | May 31, 2024   |

### 15.3.0

#### Improved Roles UI

The Roles page of the web UI will be backed by a paginated API, ensuring fast
load times even on clusters with large numbers of roles.

*Delayed from Teleport 15.1.0*

#### Database access for Spanner

Database access users will be able to connect to GCP Spanner.

#### Resizing for Windows desktop sessions

Windows desktop sessions will automatically resize as the size of the browser
window changes.

#### Hardware key support for agentless nodes

Teleport will support connecting to agentless OpenSSH nodes even when Teleport
is configured to require hardware key MFA checks.

### 15.4.0

#### Access requests notification routing rules

Hosted Slack plugin users will be able to configure notification routing rules
for role-based access requests.

#### TPM joining

The new TPM join method will enable secure joining for agents and Machine ID bots that
run on-premise. Based on the secure properties of the host's hardware trusted platform module,
this join method removes the need to create and distribute secret tokens, significantly
reducing the risk of exfiltration.

### 16.0.0

#### Teleport VNet

Teleport 16 introduces Teleport VNet, a new feature that provides a virtual IP
subnet and DNS server that automatically proxies TCP connections to Teleport
apps over mutually authenticated tunnels.

This will allow scripts and software applications to connect to any
Teleport-protected application as if they were connected to a VPN, without the
need to manage local tunnels.

#### Per-session MFA for applications

Teleport 16 will support per-session MFA checks when accessing web and TCP applications.

#### Device Trust support for the Web UI

With Teleport 16, Device Trust checks can be enforced for workflows that require the Web UI.
This includes access to web applications and Windows desktops.

Teleport Connect must be installed on user workstations in order to satisfy device checks.

## Teleport Cloud

## Production readiness

Teleport follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) for pre-releases and
releases.

### Pre-releases

Pre-releases of Teleport (versions with suffixes like `-alpha`, `-beta`, `-rc`)
should not be run in production environments.

Pre-releases of Teleport are great for testing new features, breaking changes,
and backwards incompatibility issues either in development or staging
environments.

### Major Releases

Major releases look like `(=teleport.major_version=).0.0`.

Major releases of Teleport contain many large new features and may contain
breaking changes.

Due to the scope and quantity of changes in a major release, we encourage
deploying to staging first to verify your usage pattern has not changed.

### Minor Releases

Minor releases look like `(=teleport.major_version=).X.0`.

Minor releases of Teleport typically contain smaller features and improvements.
Minor releases can typically be deployed directly to production.

Most customers upgrade to the next major version of Teleport during the first
minor release, such as (=teleport.major_version=).1.0.

### Patch Releases

Patch releases contain small bug fixes and can typically be deployed directly
to production.
