# Database Access

Teleport can provide secure access to PostgreSQL and MySQL databases, while
improving both access control and visibility.

Some of the things you can do with Database Access include:

* Allow users to retrieve short-lived database credentials using single sign-on
  flow thus maintaining their organization-wide identity.
* Configure rich role-based access control policies for databases and implement
  custom [access workflows](./enterprise/workflow/index.mdx).
* Capture database access events as well as query activity in the audit log.

## Demo

In the following demo video we connect to a PostgreSQL server with `psql` and
pgAdmin 4 after authenticating with Github, execute a few SQL queries and
observe them in the audit log.
