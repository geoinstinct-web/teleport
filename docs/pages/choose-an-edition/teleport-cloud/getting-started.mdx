title: Getting Started With Teleport Enterprise Cloud
description: Teleport hosted and managed by the Teleport team.
---

In this guide, we will show you how to get started with Teleport Enterprise
Cloud and register your first resource with Teleport so you can provide secure
access to your infrastructure.

Teleport Enterprise Cloud includes two components:

- **Teleport Auth Service:** The certificate authority for your cluster. It
  issues certificates and conducts authentication challenges.
- **Teleport Proxy Service:** The cluster frontend, which handles user requests,
  forwards user credentials to the Auth Service, and communicates with Teleport
  instances that enable access to specific resources in your infrastructure.

In this guide, you will register a server with your Teleport Cloud account so
you can access it securely. Your server will connect to the Teleport Proxy
Service and open a reverse tunnel that the Proxy Service can use to allow
traffic to the server from authorized clients.

## Prerequisites

- A Teleport Enterprise Cloud account. You can sign up for a free trial at the
  following page:

  https://goteleport.com/signup/

- Docker installed on your workstation. We will use a Docker container to
  register a server with Teleport via the Teleport SSH Service. You can find
  installation instructions on [Docker's
  website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

  <Notice type="tip">

  Docker is only required for a local demo environment. If you want to get
  started registering your servers in your infrastructure with Teleport, view
  our documentation on how to [register servers and configure access to
  them](../../server-access/introduction.mdx).

  </Notice>

- The `tsh` client tool. Visit our [Installation Guide](../../installation.mdx)
  for instructions. If you want to get started quickly, you can skip this for
  now and access Teleport through your browser.

## Step 1/4. Spin up your server

Spin up a server on your workstation. In Step 2, we will register this server
with your Teleport Enterprise Cloud tenant:

```code
$ docker run -it ubuntu:22.10 /bin/bash
```

Make sure you have installed `curl` in your container:

```code
$ apt-get update
$ apt-get install -y curl
```

Keep this shell open in your terminal for the next step.

## Step 2/4. Install the Teleport SSH Service

To install the Teleport SSH Service on your server, visit the Teleport Web UI at
the address of your Teleport Enterprise Cloud tenant. For example, visit:

https://mytenant.teleport.sh

If this is your first time visiting the Web UI, you will see a prompt to add
your first resource: 

![Add your first
resource](../../../img/cloud/getting-started/add-my-first-resource.png)

This will take you to the Teleport Discover UI:

![Select resource
type](../../../img/cloud/getting-started/select-resource-type.png)

Leave **Server** selected and click **Next**.

You will see a script that you can copy from the Teleport Web UI:

![Configure resource](../../../img/cloud/getting-started/configure-resource.png)

Copy the script and paste it into the shell you opened in the previous step.
Remove `sudo` from the start of the script so you can run it on your container.
It should look something like this:

```text
$ bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://TENANT_SUBDOMAIN.teleport.sh/scripts/SCRIPT_NAME/install-node.sh)" 
```

Leave the script running in your shell. Teleport will run in the foreground. You
will see a message in the Web UI that your new server connected successfully:

![Connected
successfully](../../../img/cloud/getting-started/successfully-connected.png)


Choose the OS user you will assume when you authenticate to the server, in this
case, `root`:

![Choose your user](../../../img/cloud/getting-started/set-up-access.png)

From there, you can test the connection and access the server. Click **Start
Session** to connect:

![Start session](../../../img/cloud/getting-started/test-connection.png)

<Notice type="tip">

If you get an error connecting to your container, interrupt the `teleport`
process in your container's shell with **Ctrl-C**, then run `teleport start` to
restart the process.

</Notice>

You should see a terminal prompt in your browser. Your Teleport Enterprise Cloud
account proxies your SSH connection through the Teleport Proxy Service, which
connects to your container via a reverse tunnel. 

## Step 3/4. Access your server from the command line

Log in to your Teleport Enterprise Cloud tenant via the command line, filling in
the URL of your tenant and the name of your Teleport user:

```code
$ tsh login --proxy=<Var name="tenant-url" /> --user=<Var name="username" />
```

List the servers your Teleport user can access. You should see the name of the
container you just registered:

```code
$ tsh ls
```

Access your server as the `root` user:

```code
$ tsh ssh root@<Var name="server-name" />
```

Run some commands in your terminal. In the next step, we will show you how you
can play back your session. When you have finished, run `exit` to end your
session.

## Step 4/4. Play back your session

While Teleport Enterprise Cloud proxies SSH connections to registered servers,
it stores recordings of SSH sessions so you can play them back later to
investigate issues.

In the Teleport Web UI, click the **Activity** tab in the sidebar on the left of
the screen, then click **Ression Recordings**. You will see your session from
the previous step:

![Session
recordings](../../../img/cloud/getting-started/session-recordings.png)

Click **PLAY**. You will see a full recording of your session.

## Next steps

Now that you have registered your first server with Teleport, read about how you
can register the rest of your infrastructure, including:

- [Additional SSH servers](../../server-access/introduction.mdx)
- [Cloud provider tools and internal web  applications](../../application-access/introduction.mdx)
- [Databases](../../database-access/introduction.mdx)
- [Kubernetes clusters](../../kubernetes-access/introduction.mdx)
- [Service accounts](../../machine-id/introduction.mdx)
- [Windows desktops](../../desktop-access.mdx)

Aside from `tsh` and the Web UI, you can also connect to Teleport with our
desktop application, [Teleport
Connect](../../connect-your-client/teleport-connect.mdx).
