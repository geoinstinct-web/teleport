# Application Access

Teleport Application Access has been designed to provide secure access to
internal dashboards and applications, building on Teleport's strong foundations
of security and identity.

You can secure any web application using application access:

- Internal control panels.
- Wikis / Tooling that's only available on the VPN.
- Infra dashboards - Kubernetes, Grafana.
- Developer tools, such as Jenkins, Gitlab or Opsgenie.

## Example Applications

As outlined in our introduction, Application Access has been designed to
support two types of applications.

### Example Legacy App

A device such as a load balancer might come with a control panel, but it
doesn't have any authentication and can only be access via a privileged network.
These applications are supported and can extend access beyond your network.

Other example legacy apps:

- An internal admin tool.
- Control panel for networking devices.

### Example Modern App

Teleport Application Access supports all modern applications, these could be
built in-house or off-the-shelf software such as Jenkins, Kubernetes Dashboard
and Jupyter workbooks.

- Kubernetes Internal Dashboard.
- Grafana.
- Jupyter notebooks.
- In-house Single Page Apps (SPA).
- SPA with custom Json Web Token support (JWT).
