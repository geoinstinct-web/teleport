# Application Access

Teleport Application Access is designed to provide secure access to
internal dashboards and applications, such as:

- Internal control panels.
- Wikis / tooling that's only available on the VPN.
- Infrastructure dashboards, such as Kubernetes or Grafana.
- Developer tools, such as Jenkins, Gitlab or Opsgenie.

## Example Legacy Apps

A device such as a load balancer might come with a control panel, but it
doesn't have any authentication and can only be access via a privileged network.
These applications are supported and can extend access beyond your network.

Other example legacy apps:

- An internal admin tool.
- Control panel for networking devices.

## Example Modern Apps

Teleport Application Access supports web applications such as internal web
tools and infrastructure software like:

- Kubernetes Dashboard.
- Grafana.
- Jupyter notebooks.
- In-house Single Page Apps (SPA).
- SPA with custom JSON Web Token support (JWT).
