This guide demonstrates how to set up the Terraform provider for Teleport on
Linux and macOS.

Terraform is intended to be used with Machine ID, Teleport's feature for providing identities to
machines and services, rather than users. This tutorial will show you how to use
a local Machine ID bot to try it out.

For instructions on managing users and roles via Terraform, read
the ["Managing users and roles with IaC" guide](./user-and-role.mdx).

For instructions on managing the Teleport dynamic resources as code using
GitOps, read the guide to using the Teleport Terraform provider with [Spacelift
and Machine ID](../../machine-id/deployment/spacelift.mdx).

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- [Terraform >= (=terraform.version=)+](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)

  ```code
  $ terraform version
  # Terraform v(=terraform.version=)
  ```

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/3. Create Teleport credentials for Terraform

Terraform needs a signed identity file from the Teleport cluster certificate
authority to manage resources in the cluster. To prepare credentials using a local Teleport bot:

1. Create a folder called `teleport-terraform` to hold temporary files:

   ```code
   $ mkdir -p teleport-terraform
   $ cd teleport-terraform
   ```

1. Terraform needs a Teleport role that gives it permission to manage your
   cluster's resources. The bot creates identity documents that have this role.
   Configure the necessary role by pasting the following content into a
   `terraform_role.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   kind: role
   metadata:
     name: terraform
   spec:
     allow:
       db_labels:
         '*': '*'
       app_labels:
         '*': '*'
       node_labels:
         '*': '*'
       rules:
         - resources:
           - app
           - cluster_auth_preference
           - cluster_networking_config
           - db
           - device
           - github
           - login_rule
           - oidc
           - okta_import_rule
           - role
           - saml
           - session_recording_config
           - token
           - trusted_cluster
           - user
           - access_list
           - node
           verbs: ['list','create','read','update','delete']
   version: v7
   ```

   These settings configure a role named `terraform` with the permissions
   required to manage resources in your Teleport cluster.

1. Create the `terraform` role by running the following command:

   ```code
   $ tctl create terraform_role.yaml
   role 'terraform' has been created
   ```

1. Create two scripts that let you quickly and repeatably create and destroy our
   local Terraform bot. First, create a new file called
   `create_and_run_terraform_bot.sh`, open it in an editor, and paste in the
   following content:

   ```shell
   #! /usr/bin/env bash

   TOKEN=$(tctl bots add terraform-test --roles=terraform --format=json | jq -r '.token_id')
   tbot start \
     --destination-dir=./terraform-identity \
     --token="$TOKEN" \
     --data-dir=./tbot-data \
     --join-method=token \
     --auth-server=tele.example.com:443
     # Replace with the host and port of your Teleport Auth Service
     # or Teleport Proxy Service
   ```

   When run, this creates a new bot with the token retrieved from the JSON output. That token
   is piped into the start command. For security reasons, we don't allow bot join tokens to be
   created in any way other than adding a bot, so for local development work, you must manually
   manage the bot and its token.

   The bot manages its state data in a folder called `tbot-data` in the current
   working directory.

1. Edit `create_and_run_terraform_bot.sh` to replace `tele.example.com:443` with
   the domain name and port of the Teleport Proxy Service in your cluster.

1. Create another file called `remove_terraform_bot.sh`, open it in an editor, and
paste in the following content:

   ```shell
   #! /usr/bin/env bash

   tctl bots rm terraform-test
   rm -rf ./terraform-identity
   rm -rf ./tbot-data
   ```

   This script will be used later to clean up our bot in between runs and when we're done.

1. In a new terminal window, run the `create_and_run_terraform_bot.sh` script to create the new bot
   and start it:

   ```code
   $ chmod +x create_and_run_terraform_bot.sh
   $ ./create_and_run_terraform_bot.sh
   ```

## Step 2/3. Prepare a Terraform configuration file

To prepare a Terraform configuration file:

1. Create a new file called `provider.tf` and open it in an editor.

1. Use the Teleport Terraform provider and connect it to your Teleport cluster 
   by pasting the following content into the `provider.tf` file:

   <Tabs>
   <TabItem scope={["cloud","team"]} label="Cloud-Hosted">
   ```hcl
   (!examples/resources/terraform/provider-cloud.tf!)
   ```
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem scope={["oss", "enterprise"]} label="Self-Hosted">
   ```hcl
   (!examples/resources/terraform/provider-self-hosted.tf!)
   ```
   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

## Step 3/3. Validate the configuration

To apply the configuration:

1. Check the contents of the `teleport-terraform` folder:

   ```code
   $ ls
   # provider.tf  terraform-identity/  create_and_run_terraform_bot.sh remove_terraform_bot.sh  terraform_role.yaml
   ```

1. Initialize the working directory that contains Terraform configuration files
   by running the following command:

   ```code
   $ terraform init
   ```

1. Execute the Terraform plan defined in the configuration file by running the
   following command:

   ```code
   $ terraform apply
   ```

1. When you're done, use Ctrl-C to stop the Terraform bot. Then run the `remove_terraform_bot.sh` script to remove the bot and clean up the `terraform-identity` folder:

   ```code
   $ chmod +x remove_terraform_bot.sh
   $ ./remove_terraform_bot.sh
   ```

   If you need to start the bot back up, you can run the two bot scripts as many times as necessary.

## Next steps

- If you have already created Teleport resources with another tool, such as
  `tctl`, learn how to [import Teleport resources into
  Terraform](./import-terraform-resources.mdx).
- Follow [the user and role IaC guide](./user-and-role.mdx) to use the Terraform
  Provider to create Teleport users and grant them roles.
- Explore the full list of supported [Terraform provider
  resources](../../reference/terraform-provider.mdx).
- See how to use Machine ID with Terraform in
  [production](../../machine-id/access-guides/terraform.mdx).
