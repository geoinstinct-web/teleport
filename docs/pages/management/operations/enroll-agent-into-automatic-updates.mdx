  Automatic agent update is available starting from Teleport `13.0`.
</Details>

Starting with Teleport 13, agents running in systemd or Kubernetes environments
can be automatically updated. The [automatic updates architecture
page](../../architecture/automatic-agent-update.mdx) describes how agent
updating works.

This guide explains how to enroll an existing Teleport agent into automatic
updates.

## Requirements

- A Teleport agent, either:
  - started via systemd
  - deployed with the `teleport-kube-agent` Helm chart
<ScopedBlock scope={["oss","enterprise"]}>
- automatic update infrastructure set up. For Self-Hosted users this means you
  already followed [this guide](./self-hosted-automatic-agent-updates.mdx) and
  know your version server URL and release channel
</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope="cloud">
- as a Teleport Cloud user, you must check if your Could Tenant is enrolled
  into automatic updates.
</ScopedBlock>

## Enroll instructions

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss","enterprise"]}>
Create the upgrade configuration directory:
  ```code
  $ mkdir -p /etc/teleport-upgrade.d/
  ```
- If you changed the agent user to run as non-root, create
  `/etc/teleport-upgrade.d/schedule` and grant ownership to your Teleport user.
  Else, you can skip this step.
  ```code
  $ touch /etc/teleport-upgrade.d/schedule
  $ chown <your-teleport-user> /etc/teleport-upgrade.d/schedule
  ```
- Configure the updater to connect to your custom version server and subscribe
  to the right release channel.
  ```code
  $ echo <version-server-url/path>/<release-channel> > /etc/teleport-upgrade.d/endpoint
  ```
<ScopedBlock scope="oss">
- install the `teleport-updater` package
  ```code
  $ apt install teleport-updater
  # or
  $ yum install teleport-updater
  ```
</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope="enterprise">
- install the `teleport-ent-updater` package (note: your teleport agent will be restarted during install)
  ```code
  $ apt install teleport-ent-updater
  # or
  $ yum install teleport-ent-updater
  ```
</ScopedBlock>
</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope="cloud">
- If you changed the agent user to run as non-root, create
  `/etc/teleport-upgrade.d/schedule` and grant ownership to your Teleport user.
  Else, you can skip this step.
  ```code
  $ mkdir -p /etc/teleport-upgrade.d/
  $ touch /etc/teleport-upgrade.d/schedule
  $ chown <your-teleport-user> /etc/teleport-upgrade.d/schedule
  ```
- install the `teleport-ent-updater` package (note: your teleport agent will be restarted during install)
  ```code
  $ apt install teleport-ent-updater
  # or
  $ yum install teleport-ent-updater
  ```
</ScopedBlock>

Finally, verify that the updater can see your version endpoint:
```code
$ teleport-upgrade dry-run
```

You should see one of the following messages, depending on the target version
you are currently serving:

```code
no upgrades available (1.2.3 == 1.2.3)
an upgrade is available (1.2.3 -> 2.3.4)
```

<Admonition type="note">
`teleport-upgrade` may complain about not having a valid upgrade schedule.
This is expected immediately after install as the maintenance schedule might
not be exported yet.
</Admonition>

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="teleport-kube-agent chart">

Add the following chart values to your existing agent `values.yaml`:

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss","enterprise"]}>
```yaml
updater:
  enabled: true
  versionServer: https://<version-server-domain-and-path>
  releaseChannel: <release-channel>
```
</ScopedBlock>

<ScopedBlock scope="cloud">

```yaml
updater:
  enabled: true
```
</ScopedBlock>

Update the Helm chart release with the new values by running `helm upgrade`.

You can validate the updater is running properly by checking if its pod is ready:
```code
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
my-agent-0                         1/1     Running   0          14m
my-agent-1                         1/1     Running   0          14m
my-agent-2                         1/1     Running   0          14m
my-agent-updater-d9f97f5dd-v57g9   1/1     Running   0          16m
```
And by consulting its logs
```code
$ kubectl logs <your-agent-release>-updater
2023-04-28T13:13:30Z	INFO	StatefulSet is already up-to-date, not updating.	{"controller": "statefulset", "controllerGroup": "apps", "controllerKind": "StatefulSet", "StatefulSet": {"name":"my-agent","namespace":"agent"}, "namespace": "agent", "name": "my-agent", "reconcileID": "10419f20-a4c9-45d4-a16f-406866b7fc05", "namespacedname": "agent/my-agent", "kind": "StatefulSet", "err": "no new version (current: \"v12.2.3\", next: \"v12.2.3\")"}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Next steps

You can temporarily suspend automatic updates for an agent:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="systemd">
Disable the systemd timer:
```code
$ systemctl disable teleport-upgrade.timer
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="teleport-kube-agent chart">
Annotate the agent deployment with `teleport.dev/skipreconcile: "true"`.
Either by setting the `annotations.deployment` value in Helm, or by patching
the deployment directly with `kubectl`.
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
