title: Run Teleport as a Daemon
description: Configure Teleport to run as a daemon using systemd
---
qOn Linux systems in non-containerized environments, we recommend running the `teleport` binary as a daemon using
systemd. Using a daemon helps to ensure that the teleport process can remain running and available regardless of a controlling terminal session or parent process, and opens up additional
configuration options that allow for better optimization, uptime, and availability.

When installing the Teleport binary from source, a systemd daemon is not pre-configured automatically, and the Teleport service called `teleport` can only be run as a
foreground process by default. In systems that have installed Teleport using DEB or RPM package managers, a systemd configuration is included, however it must be manually started.
Linux systems installing Teleport from source will need to take additional steps to configure their own teleport daemon if they need the industry standard benefits that a daemon provides.

This guide will outline best practices for installing, configuring, and starting the teleport service daemon on a Linux host using systemd as of Teleport `v10.1.4`.

## Prerequisites

- A Linux host where you will install Teleport. The host must be configured to use
systemd.

- To ensure that your host supports systemd, check whether `/sbin/init` is symbolically linked to
`/lib/systemd/systemd` or similar:

```code
$ readlink /sbin/init
/lib/systemd/systemd
```

  Teleport stores data in `/var/lib/teleport`. Make sure that regular/non-admin
  users do not have access to this folder on the Auth Service host.

</Notice>

## Install and configure Teleport

If you have not already, select and complete the appropriate installation instructions for your environment.

(!docs/pages/includes/install-linux.mdx!)

Teleport requires a [configuration yaml file](https://goteleport.com/docs/setup/reference/config/) to be created and configured in order to run. After initial installation, no
configuration file exists until it is manually created by a user. This guide will use a minimal teleport configuration based on defaults, however in production environments we
recommend [reviewing configuration file options](https://goteleport.com/docs/setup/reference/config/) to better suit your own specific needs.

To create the default teleport configuration file, enter the following command:

```code
$ sudo teleport configure -o file
Wrote config to file "/etc/teleport.yaml". Now you can start the server. Happy Teleporting!
```

## Creating and Configuring the systemd Daemon

Once you've initiially installed the `teleport` binary and created a Teleport configuration file, the Teleport daemon must be created and configured. While a daemon can be created and configured manually, the
Teleport binary includes tooling to assist users in automatically creating the necessary configuration, and package managers may include a good daemon configuration by default.

Systemd is designed to use [unit files](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html) which are the primary file used to define and set the conditions for
any needed service daemon on systemd, in this case the `teleport` service. The rest of this guide will focus on creating and configuring the teleport service daemon depending on your preferred installation method, either a package manager, or from source.

### Creating the systemd Daemon following Package Manager Installation

If Teleport is being installed using a DEB or RPM package manager, a `teleport` systemd daemon configuration will have been included as part of the teleport package installation by default. To check that this daemon was installed correctly,
enter the following command:

```code
$ sudo systemctl status teleport
```

Users will see output similar to the following, including the file path (`/lib/systemd/system/teleport.service`) that contains the unit file for the systemd configuration being applied:

```code
‚óè teleport.service - Teleport SSH Service
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/teleport.service; disabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: inactive (dead)
```

The contents of the default unit file will reflect the following defaults:

```code
[Unit]
Description=Teleport SSH Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=on-failure
EnvironmentFile=-/etc/default/teleport
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/teleport start --pid-file=/run/teleport.pid
ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID
PIDFile=/run/teleport.pid
LimitNOFILE=8192

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Users who rely on DEB or RPM can enter the following commands to enable and start the systemd `teleport` daemon at any time. Enabling the daemon using `systemctl` allows systemd to place the daemon in it's dependancy tree, ensuring that the teleport service will be automatically restarted on any potential reboot:

```code
$ sudo systemctl enable teleport.service
```

Next, the following command will officially start the teleport service daemon:

```code
$ sudo systemctl start teleport.service
```

Confirm that the Teleport daemon was installed correctly by checking the service status. The following command should output a status of `Active: active (running)`:

```code
$ sudo systemctl status teleport.service | grep Active
Active: active (running) since Mon 2022-04-18 18:33:41 UTC; 41s ago
```

### Creating the systemd Daemon When Installed From Source

Systemd is designed to use [unit files](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html) which are the primary file used to define and set the conditions for
any needed service daemon on systemd, in this case the `teleport` service. In order to more easily support systemd configurations, Teleport is capable of recommending and assisting with the installation of a default 
unit file using as little as one command (`teleport install systemd -o /unit/file/load/path`).

The following teleport command will output a [systemd unit file](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html) (using `stdout`) to the terminal to be reviewed and used as needed:

```code
$ teleport install systemd
```

The output will resemble the following:

```code
[Unit]
Description=Teleport Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=on-failure
EnvironmentFile=-/etc/default/teleport
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/teleport start --config=/etc/teleport.yaml --pid-file=/run/teleport.pid
ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID
PIDFile=/run/teleport.pid
LimitNOFILE=8192

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
***

Review the generated systemd unit file configuration. If the output describes a good configuration for your environment, enter the command once again using the `-o` flag to
write the output to the directory path of the unit file itself.
The file path `/etc/systemd/system/teleport.service` is recommended in most cases as the optimal **unit file load path**,
or the path systemd will use to apply the desired configuration. If using a different unit file load path,
it _must_ be a file path that systemd is able to support for unit file configurations. See the [full list of systemd unit file load path options]((https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html#Unit%20File%20Load%20Path)) to find
the best option for your specific configuration, and then enter the following command, replacing the unit file load path `/etc/systemd/system/teleport.service` with your own if needed:

```code
$ sudo teleport install systemd -o /etc/systemd/system/teleport.service
```

Once completed, configuration for the teleport daemon must be enabled using `systemctl` so that systemd can place it in it's dependancy tree. This also ensures that the teleport service will be automatically restarted on any potential reboot:

```code
$ sudo systemctl enable teleport.service
```

Start the teleport service daemon using systemctl:

```code
$ sudo systemctl start teleport.service
```

Finally confirm that the Teleport daemon was installed correctly by checking the service status. The following command should output a status of `Active: active (running)`:

```code
$ sudo systemctl status teleport.service | grep Active
Active: active (running) since Mon 2022-04-18 18:33:41 UTC; 41s ago
```

### Teleport Daemon Command Line Options for Unit File Configurations

The `teleport install systemd` command includes a number of optional flags that can be applied to strictly define parameters of the generated unit file and where that output will be generated.
The following table includes all command line options available with the `teleport install systemd` command, as well as a brief description of what they do, and a general recommended default tested on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**.


| Flag | Description | General Recommended Default |
| --- | ----------- | ---- |
| --fd-limit | The maximum number of open file descriptors, definted by `LimitNOFILE` in the unit file. |  **--fd-limit=8192** |
| --env-file | The path to the `EnvironmentFile` defined by the system unit file, containing any potential variables to be used in the configuration. | **--envfile=/etc/default/teleport** |
| --pid-file | The path to the pid file containing the process identification number. | **--pid-file=/run/teleport.pid** |
| --teleport-path | The full path to the teleport binary. | **--teleport-path=/usr/local/bin/teleport** |
| -o, --output | The full [unit file load path](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html#Unit%20File%20Load%20Path) which will define where to create and store the system unit file itself. This flag is used to write the output to the designated file. | **--output=/etc/systemd/system/teleport.service** |

If using the recommended defaults, all command line options can be entered in a single command as follows:

```code
teleport install systemd \
--fd-limit=8192 \
--env-file=/etc/default/teleport \
--pid-file=/run/teleport.pid \
--teleport-path=/usr/local/bin/teleport \
--output=/etc/systemd/system/teleport.service
```
