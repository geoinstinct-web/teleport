- Scheduled upgrades will limit downtime to non-peak hours

## Semantic Versioning

Teleport follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for pre-releases
and releases.

### Pre-releases

Pre-releases have suffixes `-alpha`, `-beta` and `-rc`. They are not ready for
production:

- You can use alpha releases such as `5.0.1-alpha.1` for trying new features.
  Things can break and new changes may not be backwards-compatible.
- Teleport `beta` releases, such as `5.0.1-beta.2` are suitable for staging
  environments.  We are unlikely to change the APIs while we are ironing out
  bugs and UX glitches.
- We mark release candidates as `5.0.1-rc.1` coding and bug fixes are finished.
  The team is going through the manual test plan to find any regressions.

### Releases

Releases are ready for production use.

- Releases `5.0.0` and `6.0.0` are major releases. We publish 4 major releases
  each year. Read more about upgrades and compatibility in [Upgrading a Teleport Cluster](../setup/operations/upgrading.mdx).
- Releases `5.1.0` are minor releases. They contain minor backwards-compatible
  improvements and backports.
- Versions like `5.0.1` are quick patches. They contain backwards-compatible
  fixes.
