## Teleport

### Teleport 12.1

Teleport 12.1 will deliver the following features and improvements.

### Teleport as SAML IdP (Preview)

Teleport becomes a IdP for applications that support SAML authentication. This
allows Teleport to automatically log users into a wider range of applications.

Works in proxy mode as well allowing Teleport to proxy and enrich authentication
to an upstream IdP.

### Device Trust (Preview)

Device Trust Preview has been expanded to support enforcement of device enforcement
on a per-role basis as well as the ability to lock devices.

### IP-based validation for Kubernetes and Database Access (Preview)

Teleport will be able to pin Kubernetes and database credentials to a particular IP
to prevent exfiltrated credentials from being used in a different environment.

### New hardened container images

New signed and hardened container images built on a distroless base which results
in a reduced attack surface and smaller footprint.

## Semantic Versioning

Teleport follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for pre-releases
and releases.

### Pre-releases

Pre-releases have suffixes `-alpha`, `-beta` and `-rc`. They are not ready for
production:

- You can use alpha releases such as `12.0.0-alpha.1` for trying new features.
  Things can break and new changes may not be backwards-compatible.
- Teleport `beta` releases, such as `12.0.0-beta.2` are suitable for staging
  environments.  We are unlikely to change the APIs while we are ironing out
  bugs and UX glitches.
- We mark release candidates as `12.0.1-rc.1` coding and bug fixes are finished.
  The team is going through the manual test plan to find any regressions.

### Releases

Releases are ready for production use.

- Releases `11.0.0` and `12.0.0` are major releases. We publish 4 major releases
  each year.  Read more about upgrades and compatibility
  [here](../management/operations/upgrading.mdx).
- Releases `11.1.0` are minor releases. They contain minor backwards-compatible
  improvements and backports.
- Versions like `11.0.1` are quick patches. They contain backwards-compatible
  fixes.
