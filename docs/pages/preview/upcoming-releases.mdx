The Teleport team delivers a new major release roughly every 3 months.

## Teleport

### Teleport 12.2.0

#### New hardened container images

New signed and hardened container images built on a distroless base which
results in a reduced attack surface and smaller footprint.

*Delayed from Teleport 12.0.0.*

#### (Preview) IP-based validation for Kubernetes and Database Access

Teleport will be able to pin Kubernetes and database credentials to a
particular IP to prevent exfiltrated credentials from being used in a different
environment.

*Delayed from Teleport 12.0.0.*

#### (Preview) Oracle support for Database Access

Teleport will add the ability to connect to Oracle databases to Teleport
Database Access (Audit Log support will come in a later release).

#### (Preview) GitLab CI integration for Machine ID

Machine ID will issue short-lived credentials based on GitLab CI's workload
identity, making it possible to use Teleport to access resource in CI/CD
workflows without any long-lived secrets or join tokens.

#### (Preview) Headless SSO

Teleport will introduce a new `tsh --headless` mode to allow authentication
of SSH commands on a remote machine when webauthn is enabled.
Currently, only `tsh ls`, `tsh ssh`and `tsh scp` are supported.
Support for more commands will come in a later release.

## Production readiness

Teleport follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) for pre-releases and
releases.

### Pre-releases

Pre-releases of Teleport (versions with suffixes like `-alpha`, `-beta`, `-rc`)
should not be run in production environments.

Pre-releases of Teleport are great for testing new features, breaking changes,
and backwards incompatibility issues either in development or staging
environments.

### Major Releases

Major releases look like `(=teleport.major_version=).0.0`.

Major releases of Teleport contain many large new features and may contain
breaking changes.

Due to the scope and quantity of changes in a major release, we encourage
deploying to staging first to verify your usage pattern has not changed.

### Minor Releases

Minor releases look like `(=teleport.major_version=).X.0`.

Minor releases of Teleport typically contain smaller features and improvements.
Minor releases can typically be deployed directly to production.

Most customers upgrade to the next major version of Teleport during the first
minor release, such as (=teleport.major_version=).1.0.

### Patch Releases

Patch releases contain small bug fixes and can typically be deployed directly
to production.

## Preview Policy

A product or feature may be marked as "Preview" if any of the following is
true.

- The product or feature is missing key functionality. For example, Microsoft
  SQL Server support for Database Access initially shipped without audit
  logging support.
- The product or feature has NOT been adopted by at least 2 existing customers.
- The product or feature has NOT been through a security audit.
- The documentation for the product or feature is incomplete.
- Assets (e.g. binaries) associated with the feature are not published to our
  official downloads page.

Use preview features in production if the above issues are not a concern.
