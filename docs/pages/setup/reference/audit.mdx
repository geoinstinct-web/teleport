title: Audit Events and Records
description: Reference of Teleport Audit Events and Session Records
---

Teleport logs every SSH event into its audit log. There are two components of
the audit log:

1. **Cluster Events:** Teleport logs events like successful user logins along with the metadata like remote IP address, time, and the session ID.
2. **Recorded Sessions:** Every SSH or Kubernetes shell session is recorded and can be replayed later. The recording is done by the nodes themselves, by default,
   but can be configured to be done by the proxy.
3. **Optional: [BPF Session Recording](../../server-access/guides/bpf-session-recording.mdx)**

Refer to the ["Audit Log" chapter in the Teleport
Architecture](../../architecture/authentication.mdx#audit-log) to learn more about how the Audit Log and Session Recording are designed.

## Events

Teleport supports multiple storage back-ends for storing the SSH, Application, and Kubernetes events.
The section below uses the `dir` backend as an example. `dir` backend uses the local
filesystem of an auth server using the configurable `data_dir` directory.

For High Availability configurations, users can refer to our
[DynamoDB](./backends.mdx#dynamodb) or [Firestore](./backends.mdx#firestore) chapters for information
on how to configure the SSH events and recorded sessions to be stored on
network storage. It is even possible to store the audit log in multiple places at the
same time - see `audit_events_uri` setting in the sample configuration file above for
how to do that.

Let's examine the Teleport audit log using the `dir` backend. The event log is
stored in `data_dir` under `log` directory, usually `/var/lib/teleport/log` .
Each day is represented as a file:

```code
$ ls -l /var/lib/teleport/log/

# total 104
# -rw-r----- 1 root root  31638 Jan 22 20:00 2017-01-23.00:00:00.log
# -rw-r----- 1 root root  91256 Jan 31 21:00 2017-02-01.00:00:00.log
# -rw-r----- 1 root root  15815 Feb 32 22:54 2017-02-03.00:00:00.log
```

The log files use JSON format. They are human-readable but can also be
programmatically parsed. Each line represents an event and has the following
format:

```javascript
{
    // Event type. See below for the list of all possible event types
    "event": "session.start",
    // uid: A unique ID for the event log. Useful for  deduplication.
    "uid": "59cf8d1b-7b36-4894-8e90-9d9713b6b9ef",
    // Teleport user name
    "user": "ekontsevoy",
    // OS login
    "login": "root",
    // Server namespace. This field is reserved for future use.
    "namespace": "default",
    // Unique server ID.
    "server_id": "f84f7386-5e22-45ff-8f7d-b8079742e63f",
    // Server Labels.
    "server_labels": {
      "datacenter": "us-east-1",
      "label-b": "x"
    }
    // Session ID. Can be used to replay the session.
    "sid": "8d3895b6-e9dd-11e6-94de-40167e68e931",
    // Address of the SSH node
    "addr.local": "10.5.l.15:3022",
    // Address of the connecting client (user)
    "addr.remote": "73.223.221.14:42146",
    // Terminal size
    "size": "80:25",
    // Timestamp
    "time": "2017-02-03T06:54:05Z"
}
```

The possible event types are:

| Event Type | Description |
| - | - |
| auth | Authentication attempt. Adds the following fields: `{"success": "false", "error": "access denied"}` |
| session.start | Started an interactive shell session. |
| session.end | An interactive shell session has ended. |
| session.join | A new user has joined the existing interactive shell session. |
| session.leave | A user has left the session. |
| session.disk | A list of files opened during the session. *Requires Enhanced Session Recording*. |
| session.network | A list of network connections made during the session.  *Requires Enhanced Session Recording*. |
| session.command | A list of commands ran during the session.  *Requires Enhanced Session Recording*. |
| exec | Remote command has been executed via SSH, like `tsh ssh root@node ls /`. The following fields will be logged: `{"command": "ls /", "exitCode": 0, "exitError": ""}` |
| scp | Remote file copy has been executed. The following fields will be logged: `{"path": "/path/to/file.txt", "len": 32344, "action": "read" }` |
| resize | Terminal has been resized. |
| user.login | A user logged into web UI or via tsh. The following fields will be logged: `{"user": "alice@example.com", "method": "local"}` . |
| app.session.start | A user accessed an application |
| app.session.chunk | A record of activity during an app session |

## Recorded sessions

In addition to logging `session.start` and `session.end` events, Teleport also records the entire stream of bytes going to/from standard input and standard the output of an SSH session.

Teleport can store the recorded sessions in an [AWS S3 bucket](./backends.mdx#s3)
or in a local filesystem (including NFS).

The recorded sessions are stored as raw bytes in the `sessions` directory under
`log`. Each session is a binary protobuf-encoded stream of data.

You can decode events using [`tsh play`](./cli.mdx#tsh-play) or the Web UI to replay it.

For example, replay a session via CLI:

```code
$ tsh --proxy=proxy play 4c146ec8-eab6-11e6-b1b3-40167e68e931
```

Print the session events in json to stdout:

```code
$ tsh --proxy=proxy play 4c146ec8-eab6-11e6-b1b3-40167e68e931 --format=json
```
