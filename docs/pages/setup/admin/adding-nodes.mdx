title: Adding Nodes to the cluster
description: Adding Nodes to the cluster
---

This guide explains how to add nodes to Open Source, Enterprise Teleport,
self-hosted or cloud editions.

## Prerequisites

- Installed [Teleport](../../getting-started.mdx) or [Teleport Cloud](../../cloud/introduction.mdx) >= (=teleport.version=)
- [Tctl admin tool](https://goteleport.com/teleport/download) >= (=teleport.version=)

(!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

<Admonition type="note">
For cloud, login with a teleport user with editor privileges:
```code
# tsh logs you in and receives short-lived certificates
$ tsh login --proxy=myinstance.teleport.sh --user=email@example.com
# try out the connection
$ tctl get nodes
```
</Admonition>

## Adding Nodes to the cluster

Teleport only allows access to nodes that have joined the cluster.

Once a node joins, it receives its own host certificate signed by the cluster's auth server.

To receive a host certificate upon joining a cluster, a new Teleport host must present an *invite token*.

An invite token also defines which role a new host can assume within a cluster: `auth`, `proxy`, `node`, `app`, `kube`, or `db`.

There are two ways to create invitation tokens:

- **Short-lived Dynamic Tokens** are more secure but require more planning.
- **Static Tokens** are easy to use, but less secure.

### Short-lived dynamic tokens

Administrators can generate tokens as they are needed.

Such token can be used multiple times until its time to live (TTL)
expires.

Use the [`tctl`](../reference/cli.mdx#tctl) tool to generate a new invitation token.
In the following example a new token is created with a TTL of 5 minutes:

```code
# Generate a short-lived invitation token for a new node:
$ tctl nodes add --ttl=5m --roles=node
# The invite token: (=presets.tokens.first=)

# You can also list all generated non-expired tokens:
$ tctl tokens ls
# Token                            Type            Expiry Time
# ------------------------         -----------     ---------------
# (=presets.tokens.first=)         Node            25 Sep 18 00:21 UTC

# ... or revoke an invitation token before it's used:
$ tctl tokens rm (=presets.tokens.first=)
```

### Using Node invitation tokens

Both static and short-lived dynamic tokens are used the same way. Execute the following
command on a new node to add it to a cluster:

```code
# Adding a new regular SSH node to the cluster:
$ sudo teleport start --roles=node --token=(=presets.tokens.first=) --auth-server=10.0.10.5

# Adding a new regular SSH node using Teleport Node Tunneling:
$ sudo teleport start --roles=node --token=(=presets.tokens.first=) --auth-server=teleport-proxy.example.com:3080

# Adding a new proxy service on the cluster:
$ sudo teleport start --roles=proxy --token=(=presets.tokens.first=) --auth-server=10.0.10.5
```

As new nodes come online, they start sending ping requests every few seconds to
the CA of the cluster. This allows users to explore cluster membership and size:

```code
$ tctl nodes ls

Node Name     Node ID                                  Address            Labels
---------     -------                                  -------            ------
turing        d52527f9-b260-41d0-bb5a-e23b0cfe0f8f     10.1.0.5:3022      distro:ubuntu
dijkstra      c9s93fd9-3333-91d3-9999-c9s93fd98f43     10.1.0.6:3022      distro:debian
```

## Revoking invitations

As you have seen above, Teleport uses tokens to invite users to a cluster
(sign-up tokens) or to add new nodes to it (provisioning tokens).

Both types of tokens can be revoked before they can be used. To see a list of
outstanding tokens, run this command:

```code
$ tctl tokens ls

# Token                                Role       Expiry Time (UTC)
# -----                                ----       -----------------
# (=presets.tokens.first=)     Proxy      never
# (=presets.tokens.second=)     Node       17 May 16 03:51 UTC
# (=presets.tokens.third=)     Signup     17 May 16 04:24 UTC
```

In this example, the first token has a "never" expiry date because it is a
static token configured via a config file.

The 2nd token with the "Node" role was generated to invite a new node to this
cluster. And the 3rd token was generated to invite a new user.

The latter two tokens can be deleted (revoked) via [`tctl tokens
del`](../reference/cli.mdx#tctl-tokens-rm) command:

```code
$ tctl tokens del (=presets.tokens.first=)
# Token (=presets.tokens.first=) has been deleted
```

## Adding a Node located behind NAT

<Admonition type="note">
  This feature is sometimes called "Teleport IoT" or node tunneling.
</Admonition>

With the current setup, you've only been able to add nodes that have direct access to the
auth server and within the internal IP range of the cluster. We recommend
setting up a [Trusted Cluster](../admin/trustedclusters.mdx) if you have workloads split
across different networks/clouds.

Teleport Node Tunneling lets you add a remote node to an existing Teleport Cluster through a tunnel.
This can be useful for IoT applications, or for managing a couple of servers in a different network.

Similar to [Adding Nodes to the Cluster](#adding-nodes-to-the-cluster), use `tctl` to
create a single-use token for a node, but this time you'll replace the auth
server IP with the URL of the proxy server. In the example below, we've
replaced the auth server IP with the proxy web endpoint `teleport-proxy.example.com:3080`.

```code
$ tctl tokens add --type=node | grep -oP '(?<=token:\s).*' > token.file

# This will save the token to a file.
# Run this on the new node to join the cluster:
$ sudo teleport start --roles=node --token=/path/to/token.file --auth-server=teleport-proxy.example.com:3080
```

Using the ports in the default configuration, the node needs to be able to talk to ports `3080` and `3024` on the proxy. Port `3080` is used to initially fetch the credentials (SSH and TLS certificates) and for discovery (where is the reverse tunnel running, in this case, `3024`). For those using ACME, port `443` is also required. Port `3024 `is used to establish a connection to the auth server through the proxy.

To enable multiplexing so only one port is used, simply set the `tunnel_listen_addr` the same as the
`web_listen_addr` respectively within the `proxy_service`.  Teleport will automatically recognize using the same port and enable multiplexing. If the log setting is set to DEBUG you will see multiplexing enabled in the server log.

```txt
DEBU [PROC:1]    Setup Proxy: Reverse tunnel proxy and web proxy listen on the same port, multiplexing is on. service/service.go:1944
```

  title="Load Balancers"

  The setup above also works even if the cluster uses multiple proxies behind a load balancer (LB) or a DNS entry with multiple values.  This works by the node establishing a tunnel to *every* proxy. This requires that an LB
  uses a round-robin or a similar balancing algorithm. Do not use sticky load balancing algorithms (a.k.a. "session affinity") with Teleport proxies.
</Admonition>

## Next Steps

### Untrusted auth servers

Teleport nodes use the HTTPS protocol to offer the join tokens to the auth
server running on `10.0.10.5` in the example above. In a zero-trust environment,
you must assume that an attacker can hijack the IP address of the auth server
e.g. `10.0.10.5`.

To prevent this from happening, you need to supply every new node with an
additional bit of information about the auth server. This technique is called
"CA Pinning". It works by asking the auth server to produce a "CA Pin". 
CA Pin is a hash value of the SPKI header in a certificate. An attacker can't
easilly forge a matching private key.

On the auth server:

```code
$ tctl status

# Cluster  staging.example.com
# User CA  never updated
# Host CA  never updated
# CA pin   sha256:7e12c17c20d9cb504bbcb3f0236be3f446861f1396dcbb44425fe28ec1c108f1
```

The CA pin at the bottom needs to be passed to the new nodes when they're
starting for the first time, i.e. when they join a cluster:

Via CLI:

```code
$ sudo teleport start \
   --roles=node \
   --token=(=presets.tokens.first=) \
   --ca-pin=sha256:7e12c17c20d9cb504bbcb3f0236be3f446861f1396dcbb44425fe28ec1c108f1 \
   --auth-server=10.12.0.6:3025
```

or via `/etc/teleport.yaml` on a node:

```yaml
teleport:
  auth_token: "(=presets.tokens.first=)"
  ca_pin: "sha256:7e12c17c20d9cb504bbcb3f0236be3f446861f1396dcbb44425fe28ec1c108f1"
  auth_servers:
    - "10.12.0.6:3025"
```

<Admonition
  type="warning"
  title="Warning"
>
  If a CA pin is not provided, the Teleport Node will join a
  cluster but it will print a `WARN` message (warning) into its standard error output.
</Admonition>

<Admonition

  The CA pin becomes invalid if a Teleport administrator
  performs the CA rotation by executing
  [`tctl auth rotate`](../reference/cli.mdx#tctl-auth-rotate) .
</Admonition>

### Insecure: Static tokens

<Admonition type="warning">
Use short-lived tokens instead of long-lived static tokens.
Static tokens are easier to steal, guess or leak.
</Admonition>

Static tokens are defined ahead of time by an administrator and stored in the
auth server's config file:

```yaml
# Config section in `/etc/teleport.yaml` file for the auth server
auth_service:
    enabled: true
    tokens:
    # This static token allows new hosts to join the cluster as "proxy" or "node"
    - "proxy,node:secret-token-value"
    # A token can also be stored in a file. In this example the token for adding
    # new auth servers are stored in /path/to/tokenfile
    - "auth:/path/to/tokenfile"
```
