## Production releases

<Admonition type="warning">
Avoid running pre-releases (release candidates) in production environments.
</Admonition>

The Teleport development team uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) which makes it easy to tell if a specific
version is recommended for production use.

## Component compatibility

When running multiple binaries of Teleport within a cluster (nodes, proxies,
clients, etc), the following rules apply:

**Before 5.0.0**

- **Only patch** versions are always compatible, for example, any 4.0.1 component will work with any 4.0.3 component.
- Minor versions are always compatible with the **previous** minor release. This means you must not attempt to upgrade from 4.1.x straight to 4.3.x. You must upgrade to 4.2.x first.
- Teleport clients [`tsh`](../reference/cli.mdx#tsh) for users and [`tctl`](../reference/cli.mdx#tctl) for admins
  may not be compatible with different versions of the `teleport` service.

**After 5.0.0**

- **Patch and minor** versions are always compatible, for example, any 5.0.1 component will work with any 5.0.3 component and 6.1.0 component will work with any 6.7.0 component.
- Major versions are always compatible with the **previous** major release. This means you must not attempt to upgrade from 5.x.x straight to 7.x.x. You must upgrade to 6.x.x first.
- The above applies to both clients and servers. For example, a 6.x.x proxy is
  compatible with 5.x.x nodes and 5.x.x `tsh`. But we don't guarantee that a
  7.x.x `tsh` will work with a 5.x.x proxy.

## Backup

Backup before upgrading. We have more instructions in [Backing up Teleport](./backup-restore.mdx).

## Upgrade Sequence

When upgrading a single Teleport cluster:

1. **Upgrade the auth server first**. The auth server keeps the cluster state and if there are data format changes introduced in the new version this will perform necessary migrations.
2. Then, upgrade the proxy servers. The proxy servers are stateless and can be upgraded in any sequence or at the same time.
3. Finally, upgrade the SSH nodes in any sequence or at the same time.

>
  If several auth servers are running in High Availability configuration
  (for example, in AWS auto-scaling group) you have to shrink the group to
  **just one auth server** before performing an upgrade. While Teleport will attempt to perform any necessary migrations, we recommend users create a backup of their backend before upgrading the Auth Server, as a
  precaution. This allows for a safe rollback in case the migration itself fails.
</Admonition>

When upgrading multiple clusters:

1. First, upgrade the main cluster, i.e. the one which other clusters trust.
2. Upgrade the trusted clusters.

## Upgrading to Teleport 4.0+

Teleport 4.0+ switched to GRPC and HTTP/2 as an API protocol. The HTTP/2 spec bans
two previously recommended ciphers. `tls-rsa-with-aes-128-gcm-sha256` & `tls-rsa-with-aes-256-gcm-sha384`, make sure these are removed from `teleport.yaml`

Whenever Teleport is using those cipher suites, it will experience connectivity issues between components starting 4.0+.

```yaml
    # remove those two ciphersuites from the 
    ciphersuites:
       - tls-rsa-with-aes-128-gcm-sha256
       - tls-rsa-with-aes-256-gcm-sha384
```


Rotate CA to `SHA-256` or `SHA-512` for RSA SSH certificate signatures.

The previous default was `SHA-1`, which is now considered weak against brute-force attacks.
`SHA-1` certificate signatures are also no longer accepted by `OpenSSH` versions `8.2` and above.

All new Teleport clusters will default to `SHA-512` based signatures.

To upgrade an existing cluster, set the following in auth server's `teleport.yaml`:

```yaml
teleport:
  ca_signature_algo: "rsa-sha2-512"
```

Finally, rotate the cluster CA [following these docs](./ca-rotation.mdx).
