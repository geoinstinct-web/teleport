## Certificate Authority Rotation

Take a look at the [Certificates chapter](../../architecture/authentication.mdx#authentication-in-teleport) in the
architecture document to learn how the certificate authority rotation works.

This section will show you how to implement certificate rotation in practice.

During manual and semi-automatic certificate authority rotation, Teleport generates a new certificate
authority and issues certificates for auth servers, proxies, nodes and users.

Rotation consists of several phases:

- `standby` All operations have completed or haven't started yet.
- `init` - All components are notified of the rotation. A new certificate authority is issued, but not used.
  It is necessary for remote trusted clusters to fetch the new certificate authority, otherwise the new clients
  will reject it.
- `update_clients` - internal clients certs are updated and reloaded.
  Servers will use and respond with old credentials because clients have no idea about new certificates at first.
- `update_servers` Servers will reload and would start serving
TLS and SSH certificates signed by the new certificate authority, but will still accept certificates
issued by old certificate authority.
- `rollback` rotation is rolling back to the old certificate authority.

Both in manual and semi-automatic rotation, cluster goes through the states above in sequence:

- `standby` -> `init` -> `update_clients` -> `update_servers` -> `standby`

Administrators can rollback all the changes before rotation is completed by entering `standby`.

For example, if admin has detected that some nodes failed to upgrade during `update_servers`,
they can rollback to the previous certificate authority:

- `update_servers` -> `rollback` -> `standby`.

<Admonition>
Try rotation/rollback in manual mode first to understand all the edge-cases
and gotchas before going with semi-automatic version.
</Admonition>

## Manual rotation

In manual mode, we would transition between phases while monitoring the state of the cluster.

**Start the rotation**

Initiate the manual rotation of host certificate authorities:

```code
$ tctl auth rotate --phase=init --manual --type=host
Updated rotation phase to "init". To check status use 'tctl status'
```

Cluster status will reflect active rotation in progress:

```code
$ tctl status
# Cluster  acme.cluster
# Version  (=teleport.version=)
# Host CA  initialized (mode: manual, started: Sep 20 01:44:36 UTC, ending: Sep 21 07:44:36 UTC)
# User CA  rotated Sep 20 01:42:54 UTC
# Jwt CA   rotated Sep 20 01:42:54 UTC
# CA pin   sha256:hash
```

Check the status of connected nodes:

```code
# Check rotation status of the nodes
$ tctl get nodes --format=json | jq '.[] | {hostname: .spec.hostname, rotation: .spec.rotation.state, phase: .spec.rotation.phase}'
{
  "hostname": "terminal",
  "rotation": "in_progress",
  "phase": "init"
}
```

Host `terminal` has updated it status to phase `init`. It has downloaded a new CA public key and is ready
for state transitions.

<Admonition type="warning" title="Rotation warning"
>
If some nodes are offline during rotation or have failed to update the status,
you will lose connectivity after the transition `update_servers` -> `standby`. Make sure that all
nodes are up to date with the transitions.
</Admonition>

**Update clients**

Execute transition `init` -> `update_clients`:

```code
$ tctl auth rotate --phase=update_clients --manual
# Updated rotation phase to "init". To check status use 'tctl status'
$ tctl status
# Cluster  acme.cluster
# Version  (=teleport.version=)
# Host CA  rotating clients (mode: manual, started: Sep 20 01:44:36 UTC, ending: Sep 21 07:44:36 UTC)
```

<Admonition type="note">
Clients will temporarily lose connectivity during proxy and auth servers restarts.
</Admonition>

Verify that nodes have caught up and now see the current cluster state:

```code
$ tctl get nodes --format=json | jq '.[] | {hostname: .spec.hostname, rotation: .spec.rotation.state, phase: .spec.rotation.phase}'
{
  "hostname": "terminal",
  "rotation": "in_progress",
  "phase": "update_clients"
}
```

**Update servers**

All nodes have caught up. Execute the transition `update_clients` -> `update_servers`:

```code
$ tctl auth rotate --phase=update_servers --manual
# Updated rotation phase to "init". To check status use 'tctl status'

$ tctl status
# Cluster  acme.cluster
# Version  (=teleport.version=)
# Host CA  rotating servers (mode: manual, started: Sep 20 01:44:36 UTC, ending: Sep 21 07:44:36 UTC)
```

<Admonition type="note">
Usually if things go wrong, they go wrong at this transition. If you have lost connectivity to nodes,
[rollback](#rollback) to the old certificate authority.
</Admonition>

Verify that nodes have caught up:

```code
$ tctl get nodes --format=json | jq '.[] | {hostname: .spec.hostname, rotation: .spec.rotation.state, phase: .spec.rotation.phase}'
{
  "hostname": "terminal",
  "rotation": "in_progress",
  "phase": "update_servers"
}
```

**Finish the rotation**

Before wrapping up, verify that you have not lost any nodes and can connect to them, for example:

```code
$ tsh ssh hello@terminal hostname
```

<Admonition type="warning">
This is the last stage when you can rollback. If you have lost connectivity to nodes,
[rollback](#rollback) to the old certificate authority.
</Admonition>

```code
$ tctl auth rotate --phase=standby --manual
# Updated rotation phase to "init". To check status use 'tctl status'

$ tctl status
# Cluster  acme.cluster
# Version  (=teleport.version=)
# Host CA  rotating servers (mode: manual, started: Sep 20 01:44:36 UTC, ending: Sep 21 07:44:36 UTC)
```

Cluster status should indicate succesffully completed rotation.

```code
tctl status
Cluster  acme.cluster
Version  (=teleport.version=)
Host CA  rotated Sep 20 02:11:25 UTC
User CA  rotated Sep 20 01:42:54 UTC
Jwt CA   rotated Sep 20 01:42:54 UTC
CA pin   sha256:hash
```

Nodes should catch up and be on standby:

```code
$ tctl get nodes --format=json | jq '.[] | {hostname: .spec.hostname, rotation: .spec.rotation.state, phase: .spec.rotation.phase}'
{
  "hostname": "terminal",
  "rotation": "standby",
  "phase": "standby"
}
```

<Admonition
  type="warning"
  title="CA Pinning Warning"
>
If you are using [CA Pinning](../admin/adding-nodes.mdx#untrusted-auth-servers) when adding new nodes, the CA pin will change after the rotation.
Make sure you use the *new* CA pin when adding nodes after rotation.
</Admonition>

## Semi-Automatic rotation

<Admonition type="warning">
Semi-automatic rotation executes the same steps as the manual rotation, but with a grace period between them.
It currently does not track the states of the nodes and you can lose connectivity if things go wrong.
</Admonition>

You can trigger semi-automatic rotation:

```code
$ tctl auth rotate
```

This will trigger a rotation process for both hosts and users with a *grace period* of 48 hours.
During the grace period, certificates issued both by old and new certificate authority work.

You can customize grace period:

```code
# Rotate only user certificates with a grace period of 200 hours:
$ tctl auth rotate --type=user --grace-period=200h

# Rotate only host certificates with a grace period of 8 hours:
$ tctl auth rotate --type=host --grace-period=8h
```

The rotation takes time, especially for hosts, because each node in a cluster
needs to be notified that a rotation is taking place and request a new
certificate for itself before the grace period ends.

<Admonition
  type="warning"
  title="Warning"
>
  Be careful when choosing a grace period when rotating host certificates. The grace period needs to be long enough for all nodes in a cluster to request a new certificate. If some nodes go offline during the
  rotation and come back only after the grace period has ended, they will be
  forced to leave the cluster, i.e. users will no longer be allowed to SSH
  into them.
</Admonition>

Check the cluster status of rotation:

```code
tctl status
Cluster  acme.cluster
Version  (=teleport.version=)
Host CA  initialized (mode: manual, started: Sep 20 01:44:36 UTC, ending: Sep 21 07:44:36 UTC)
```

<Admonition
  type="warning"
  title="CA Pinning Warning"
>
  If you are using [CA Pinning](../admin/adding-nodes.mdx#untrusted-auth-servers) when adding new nodes, the CA pin will change after the rotation. Make sure you use the
  *new* CA pin when adding nodes after rotation.
</Admonition>

Check the status of individual nodes:

```code
# Check rotation status of the nodes
$ tctl get nodes --format=json | jq '.[] | {hostname: .spec.hostname, rotation: .spec.rotation.state, phase: .spec.rotation.phase}'
{
  "hostname": "terminal",
  "rotation": "in_progress",
  "phase": "init"
}
```

Host `terminal` has updated it status to phase `init`. It has downloaded a new CA public key and is ready
for state transitions.

## Rollback

Rollback is only possible before rotation enters `standby` state.

First, override the rotation to the manual rollback:

```code
$ tctl auth rotate --phase=rollback --manual
# Updated rotation phase to "rollback". To check status use 'tctl status'
```

Make sure that nodes that have updated have caught up:

```code
# Check rotation status of the nodes
$ tctl get nodes --format=json | jq '.[] | {hostname: .spec.hostname, rotation: .spec.rotation.state, phase: .spec.rotation.phase}'
{
  "hostname": "terminal",
  "rotation": "in_progress",
  "phase": "rollback"
}
```

If any of the nodes were lost and using the old cert authority, they should reconnect
once you switch the control plane to the old cert authority.
