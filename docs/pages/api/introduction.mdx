The Teleport Auth API provides a gRPC API for remotely interacting with a Teleport Auth server.

Teleport has a public [Go client](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gravitational/teleport/api/client)
to programatically interact with the API. [tsh and tctl](../reference/cli.mdx) use the same API.

## Go client

Starting with Teleport 12, the API client is a versioned Go module.

The API client uses the same versioning scheme as Teleport itself, and upholds the same
compabitility rules. Namely, a client can talk to Teleport servers that are at the same
major version or one major version ahead. For example, a v11 API client is compabible
with a Teleport 12 cluster.

The inverse is not necessarily true - a v12 API client may work with a v11 Teleport cluster,
but this is not an officially supported configuration and is not guaranteed to work.

To add a dependency on Teleport's API module, you first need to determine the version
of the API module you'd like to pull in. For example, if you want to use the API module
that corresponds to the Teleport 12.0.1 release, run the following:

```
$ go get github.com/gravitational/teleport/api/v12@v12.0.1
```

In this example, `github.com/gravitational/teleport/api/v12` is the module path, and
`v12.0.1` is the the version.

The import path in Go programs using this module will be 
`github.com/gravitational/teleport/api/v12`, and the package name is `api`.

Here is what you can do with the Go Client:
 - Integrating with external tools, which we have already done 
   for [several tools](../access-controls/access-request-plugins/index.mdx),
   such as Slack, Jira, and Mattermost.
 - Writing a program/bot to manage Access Requests automatically, based on your use case. One idea
   is to allow/deny developer requests based on their currently assigned tasks.
 - Performing CRUD actions on resources, such as `roles`, `auth connectors`, and `provisioning tokens`.
 - Dynamically configuring Teleport.

Create an API client in 3 minutes with the [Getting Started Guide](./getting-started.mdx).
