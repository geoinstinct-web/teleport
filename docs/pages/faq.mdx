## Can I use Teleport in production today?

Teleport has been deployed on server clusters with thousands of hosts at
Fortune 500 companies. It has been through several security audits from
nationally recognized technology security companies, so we are comfortable with
the stability of Teleport from a security perspective.

## Can Teleport be deployed in agentless mode?

Yes.

With Teleport in agentless mode, you can easily control access to SSH servers,
Kubernetes clusters, desktops, databases, and internal applications without running any
additional software on your servers. Agentless mode supports session recordings
and audit logs for deep understanding into user behavior.

For capabilities such as kernel-level logging and user provisioning,
we recommend Teleport as a drop in replacement for OpenSSH. Since Teleport
replaces the OpenSSH agent while preserving OpenSSH's functionality, you get
more functionality without a net addition of an agent on your system.

Here are details about running each of Teleport's resource services in agentless
mode. All resource services except for the Node/SSH Service act as proxies for
client traffic:

|Service|Supports agent mode|Supports agentless mode|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|[Application Service](./application-access/introduction.mdx)|&#10004;|&#10004;|Proxies HTTP requests to a user-configured list of applications, which can run on the same host as the `teleport` daemon or at a remote endpoint.|
|[Database Service](./database-access/introduction.mdx)|&#10004;|&#10004;|Proxies database-specific protocol traffic to a user-configured list of databases, which can run on the same host as the `teleport` daemon or at a remote endpoint.|
|[Kubernetes Service](./kubernetes-access/introduction.mdx)|&#10006;|&#10004;|Proxies client traffic to the API server of a registered Kubernetes cluster.|
|[Node/SSH Service](./server-access/introduction.mdx)|&#10004;|&#10004;|You can configure OpenSSH clients and servers to trust Teleport's CA. See our [OpenSSH guide](./server-access/guides/openssh.mdx).<br/><br/>For full functionality, you can run the Node Service, which implements SSH, on each server in your infrastructure.|
|[Windows Desktop Service](./desktop-access/introduction.mdx)|&#10006;|&#10004;|Proxies RDP traffic from client browsers to remote Windows servers.|

## Can I use OpenSSH with a Teleport cluster?

Yes, this question comes up often and is related to the previous one. Take a
look at [Using OpenSSH Guide](./server-access/guides/openssh.mdx).

## Can I connect to Nodes behind a firewall?

Yes, Teleport supports reverse SSH tunnels out of the box. To configure
behind-firewall clusters refer to our
[Trusted Clusters](./management/admin/trustedclusters.mdx) guide.

## Can individual agents create reverse tunnels to the Proxy Service without creating a new cluster?

Yes. When running a Teleport agent, use the `--auth-server` flag to point to the
Proxy Service address (this would be `public_addr` and `web_listen_addr` in your
file configuration). For more information, see
[Adding Nodes to the
Cluster](./management/join-services-to-your-cluster/join-token.mdx).

## Can Nodes use a single port for reverse tunnels?

Yes, Teleport supports tunnel multiplexing on a single port. Set the
`tunnel_listen_addr` to use the same port as the `web_listen_addr` address
setting in the `proxy_service` configuration. Teleport will automatically use
multiplexing with that configuration.

## I'm getting `ssh: subsystem request failed` while I try to copy files, what to do?

Make sure that all Teleport components are at least at version 10.3.0. Older versions
don't support the SFTP protocol, and it's enabled by default in `tsh` v11.0.0 and OpenSSH v9.0.

## How is Open Source different from Enterprise?

Teleport provides four editions:

- Teleport Team
- Teleport Enterprise
- Teleport Enterprise Cloud
- Teleport Community Edition

Here is a detailed breakdown of the differences between Teleport's editions.

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-comparison.mdx!)

## Which version of Teleport is supported?

Teleport provides security-critical support for the current and two previous
releases. With our typical release cadence, this means a release is usually
supported for 9 months.

### Supported versions

Here are the major versions of Teleport and their support windows:

| Release | Release Date     | EOL          | Minimum `tsh` version|
|---------|------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| v13.0   | May 8, 2023      | February 2024| v12.x.x              |
| v12.0   | Feb 6, 2023      | November 2023| v11.x.x              |
| v11.0   | October 24, 2022 | July 2023    | v10.x.x              |

See our [Upgrading](./management/operations/upgrading.mdx) guide for more
information.

### Version compatibility

(!docs/pages/includes/compatibility.mdx!)

## Does the Web UI support copy and paste?

Yes. You can copy and paste using a mouse.

## What TCP ports does Teleport use?

Please refer to our [Networking](./reference/networking.mdx) guide.

## Does Teleport support authentication via OAuth, SAML, or Active Directory?

Teleport offers this feature for the [Enterprise versions of Teleport](choose-an-edition/teleport-enterprise/introduction.mdx).

## Why do I see an alert that some agents are out of date?

Teleport monitors the inventory of all cluster components and compares their
Teleport versions with the latest release on our GitHub page. If a component is
not on the latest release, Teleport will create a cluster alert encouraging
users to upgrade.

This check is performed against all cluster components, including the Proxy
Service and Auth Service, as well as agents running other Teleport Services.

## Can I suppress warnings about available upgrades?

Yes. The `tctl alerts ack` command can be used to acknowledge an alert and
temporarily prevent it from being displayed to users. To acknowledge an alert,
you need its ID. You can get a listing of all alerts and their IDs with the
`tctl alerts list` command.

For detailed information on this family of commands, see the
[CLI Reference](./reference/cli.mdx#tctl-alerts-list).

## Does Teleport send any data back to the cloud?

The open source edition of Teleport does not send any information to our
company, and can be used on servers without internet access.

The commercial editions of Teleport can optionally be configured to send
anonymized information, depending on the license purchased. This information
contains the following:

- Teleport license identifier;
- anonymized cluster name and Teleport auth server host ID;
- for each Teleport user, the anonymized user name and a per-protocol count of
  interactions - Teleport logins, SSH and Kubernetes exec sessions, Application
  access web sessions and TCP connections, SSH port forwards, Kubernetes API
  requests, SFTP actions.

The anonymization is done by passing names and IDs through HMAC-SHA-256, with a
HMAC key that's randomly generated when the Teleport cluster is initialized for
the first time and is never shared with us; this makes it infeasible for anyone
without access to the cluster to deanonymize the data we store.

The code that aggregates and anonymizes this data can be found [in our
repository on
GitHub](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/tree/master/lib/usagereporter/teleport/aggregating).

Reach out to `sales@goteleport.com` if you have questions about the commercial
editions of Teleport.

### Teleport Connect
