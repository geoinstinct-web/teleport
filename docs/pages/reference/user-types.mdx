This guide explains the different kinds of users in Teleport, how they are
created, and their properties.

## Local Users

Local users are created directly in Teleport. They are not coming from an
external system like an identity provider.

Local users can be created via the CLI (`tctl users add`), by applying a user
resource manifest (`tctl create -f user.yaml`) or via the web UI. Their roles
and traits can be modified directly in Teleport.

Those users can connect to Teleport directly via username/password and/or
additional authentication factors such as webauthn physical tokens, passkeys or
One Time Passwords.

Local user login can be disabled via `cluster_auth_preference` or `teleport.yaml`.
Disabling local authentication is required for [FIPS/FedRAMP compliance
](../access-controls/compliance-frameworks/fedramp.mdx).

### Special case: Bots

Machine ID provides machines with an identity that can authenticate to the
Teleport cluster. This identity is known as a bot. Bots are represented in
Teleport by a user and a role resource and can be created via the
`tctl bots add` command.

Bots are not logging in like human users with a password, MFA or SSO. They join
the cluster as Teleport services using [a join method](./join-methods.mdx). They
can still join even if local auth is disabled.

## SSO users

Those users are imported in Teleport from an external identity provider.
Teleport contains a user resource representing those users, but it's only a
representation of a user of a remote system.

Remote users don't log in directly in Teleport, they are redirected to their
identity provider to perform the login challenge.

Those users cannot be edited via `tctl`, or via any other IaC tooling like
Terraform or the Teleport Kubernetes Operator. They are managed by 

### Temporary users

Users logging in via GitHub, SAML, or OIDC connectors are created in Teleport
after a successful login. At that time, their roles and traits are computed
according to the connector mappings.

Those users are short-lived, they are created when a Teleport session is opened
and automatically expires after a few days. Those users cannot be edited via
`tctl`, only deleted.

### Synced users

Since version 15, Teleport supports fetching users from external identity
providers like Okta.

Synchronizing users from the external IdP allows all users to be represented in
Teleport, whether they logged in Teleport or not. The benefits of such
integration are:
- Automatic user locking and deletion if the user is suspended or removed in the
  IdP.
- Ability to see all users within Teleport regardless of the last login date.
- All IdP users are displayed in Teleport Access Graph.

The Okta synchronization service is in charge of creating new users when they
are created in Okta, and locking/deleting users if they get deactivated/removed
in Okta.

Those users can be identified by the label `teleport.dev/origin: okta` and
cannot be edited via `tctl`, only deleted.
