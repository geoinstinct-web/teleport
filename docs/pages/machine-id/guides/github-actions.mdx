title: Using Machine ID With Github Actions
description: A tutorial for using Machinie ID with Github Actions
---

Github actions are a popular CI/CD platform that works as a larger part of the Github
ecosystem. Teleport, with the help of Machine ID, allows for Github actions to
securely interact with Teleport Protected resources without the need for long lived
credentials. By ensuring that rotated Machine ID credentials are additionally limited by RBAC,
Github actions with Teleport can be applied as both a viable and secure solution whenever a
CI/CD platform is needed.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- A Linux based host that can support Machine ID. This "Machine ID Host
  ```code
  $ ssh -V
  ```

- A node that is a part of the Teleport cluster with the SSH service installed.

- A machine with `tsh` access to the cluster.

- A Github repository with Github actions enabled. This guide uses the example `gravitational/example`
repo, however this value should be replaced with your own unique repo.

## Step 1/3. Create a join Token for Github Actions

Github Actions will need it's own join token in order to be able to join the cluster.
Using a text editor of your choice, create a configuration YAML file `tokenconfig.yaml` for the
join token that resembles the following:

```yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  name: github-demo
  expires: "3000-01-01T00:00:00Z"
spec:
  roles: [Bot]
  join_method: github
  bot_name: github-demo
  github:
    allow:
      - repository: gravitational/example
```

Let's go over the token configuration YAML in more detail:

- `metadata.name` and `spec.bot_name` in this case represent the name of the
bot that will be configured with Machine ID. In this case, the bot will be named
`github-demo`, however this can be changed to any name of your choice. Note that this value will
need to be used in other parts of the configuration later.

- `metadata.expires` defines the date that the join token will expire. This example is set
to the year `3000`, however care should be taken in production in order to Ensure
that the expiration date will not be given a value that is greater than what is needed.

- `spec.roles` defines the role for the bot user. The value of `[Bot]` ensures that only bots are
allowed to join the cluster using this token, reducing the scope of privileges.

- `spec.join_method` defines the join method the token is applicable for. Since this guide
only focuses on Github Actions, this value should always be equal to `github`.

- `spec.github.allow` field is used to set the Github repository that the Github actions will
be applied to. The example `gravitational/example` repo used in this file should be replaced
with your own.

Once the configuration YAML file has been created, apply it to your cluster using `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl create tokenconfig.yaml
```

The token `github-demo` can now be observed with the following command, ready to be used by
Github:

```code
$ sudo tctl tokens ls
```

## Step 2/3. Creating your Machine ID bot

With the join token for Github actions created, the next step is to create the Machine ID bot,
and ensure that is configured to use the created token. This bot can be created using a Teleport
`configuration.yaml` file, however for the purposes of this guide you will create a simple configuration
using `tctl` with any required configuration flags.

The Machine ID bot created in this example will be used to access a specific node on the cluster
via `tsh ssh`, and will therefore require a role that can access the cluster as needed. This example
configuration will apply the `access` role, however care should be taken to either create or apply
a role according to the principle of least privelege in production environments. Additionally, it
should have explicit access to the cluster using a username created specifically for the bot user alone.

Enter the following command from your host with `tsh` access, replacing the `username` value with
the username affiliated with a node the bot will be required to access over a `tsh ssh` session:

```
$ tctl bots add github-demo --roles=access --token=github-demo â€“logins=username
```

## Step 3/3. Configuring Github Actions

Now that the bot has been successfully created, github actions can succesfully function as part of the Teleport cluster.

In the Github workflows directory of your repo, generally `/.github/workflows/`, create a new workflow YAML file,
in this case `actionstest.yml` that will reflect the action you'd like to configure. This guide will create an action that
will both list nodes within the cluster using `tsh ls`, as well as write the commit SHA that triggered the workflow to
a file within the bot node. To create this configuration, use the following YAML file:

```YAML
# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actionsname: Demo.
# Will take the following action whenever a push is made to the "main" branch.
on:
 push:
   branches:
     - main
jobs:
 demo:
   permissions:
# This is required or tbot will not be able to authenticate.
     id-token: write
     contents: read
# The name of the action, and the Linux distro to be used to perform the required steps.
   name: guide-demo
   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
   steps:
     - name: Checkout repository
       uses: actions/checkout@v3
     - name: Fetch Teleport binaries
       uses: gravitational/teleport-actions/setup@main
       with:
         version: 11.0.0
     - name: Fetch credentials
       run: >
         tbot start
         --join-method=github
         --token=github-demo
# Use the address of the auth server for your own cluster.
         --auth-server=authserver.domain:443
         --oneshot
         --destination-dir=./certs
         --data-dir=./data
     - name: List nodes
# Enters a command from the cluster, in this case "tsh ls" using Machine ID credentials to list remote SSH nodes.
# Ensure that the domain "authserver.domain" matches the auth server of your own cluster.
       run: >
         tsh -i ./certs/identity
         --proxy=authserver.domain:443
         ls
     - name: Write file to remote
# Enters a command from the cluster, in this case "tsh ssh" using Machine ID credentials to gain SSH access to an SSH node, and then write the commit hash to the "github_run_log_2" file.
# Ensure that the domain matches the auth server, that `username` matches the username of a remote SSH username, and that hostname matches an SSH host name that is a part of the Teleport cluster configured for access.
       run: >
         tsh -i ./certs/identity
         --proxy authserver.domain:443
         ssh username@hostname
         "echo $GITHUB_SHA >> ~/github_run_log_2"
```

Add, commit, and push your changes to the `main` branch of the repository.

Navigate to the **Actions** tab of your github repository in a web browser of your choice. Select
the **Workflow** that has now been created and triggered by the change, and select the `guide-demo` job.
The Github action may take some time to complete, however will resemble the following once successful.

![Github Actions](../../../img/machine-id/github-actions.png)

Unfurl the `List nodes` step of the action, and the output will
list all nodes in the cluster, from the perspective of the
TSH user configured for Machine ID using the command `tsh ls`.
