title: Deploying Machine ID on GitHub Actions
description: How to install and configure Machine ID on GitHub Actions
---

GitHub Actions is a popular CI/CD platform that works as a part of the larger GitHub
ecosystem. Teleport, with the help of Machine ID, allows for GitHub Actions to
securely interact with Teleport protected resources without the need for long lived
credentials. By ensuring that rotated Machine ID credentials are additionally limited by RBAC,
GitHub Actions with Teleport can be applied as both a viable and secure solution whenever a
CI/CD platform is needed.

Teleport supports secure joining on both GitHub-hosted and self-hosted GitHub
Actions runners as well as GitHub Enterprise Server.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- Your user should have the privileges to create token resources.
- A GitHub repository with GitHub Actions enabled. This guide uses the example
`gravitational/example` repo, however this value should be replaced with
your own unique repo.

## Step 1/3. Create a join token for GitHub Actions

In order to allow your GitHub Actions workflow to authenticate with your
Teleport cluster, you'll first need to create a join token. These tokens set out
criteria by which the Auth Server decides whether to allow a bot or node
to join.

Create a file named `bot-token.yaml` and insert the following contents:

```yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  name: example-bot
spec:
  roles: [Bot]
  join_method: github
  bot_name: example
  github:
    allow:
    - repository: gravitational/example
```

<Admonition type="note" title="GitHub Enterprise Server">
From Teleport 11.1.4, users with Teleport Enterprise are able to permit
workflows within GitHub Enterprise Server instances to authenticate using the
GitHub join method.

To configure this, set `spec.github.enterprise_server_host` to the hostname of
the GHES instance.

For example:
```yaml
spec:
  github:
    enterprise_server_host: ghes.example.com
```
</Admonition>

Let's go over the token resource YAML's fields in more detail:

- `metadata.name` defines the name of the token. Note that this value will need
to be used in other parts of the configuration later.
- `metadata.expires` defines the date that the join token will expire. This
example is set to the year `2100`.
- `spec.bot_name` is the name of the Machine ID bot that this token will grant
access to. Note that this value will need to be used in other parts of the
configuration later.
- `spec.roles` defines which roles that this token will grant access to. The
value of `[Bot]` states that this token grants access to a Machine ID bot.
- `spec.join_method` defines the join method the token is applicable for. Since
this guide only focuses on GitHub Actions, we will set this to to `github`.
- `spec.github.allow` is used to set rules for what GitHub Actions will be able
to authenticate by using the token. In this example, the `gravitational/example`
repository is used, and this example repository should be replaced with your own
repo.

You can find a full list of the token configuration options for GitHub Actions
joining on the
[GitHub Actions reference page.](../reference/github-actions.mdx#github-join-token)

Once the resource file has been written, create the token with `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl create -f bot-token.yaml
```

Check that token `example-bot` has been created with the following
command:

```code
$ tctl tokens ls
Token       Type Labels Expiry Time (UTC)
----------- ---- ------ ----------------------------------------------
example-bot Bot         01 Jan 00 00:00 UTC (2562047h47m16.854775807s)
```

## Step 2/3. Create your Machine ID bot

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/blank-role.mdx!)

Create the bot, specifying the role and token that you have created:

```code
$ tctl bots add example --roles=example-bot --token=example-bot
```

## Step 3/3. Configure GitHub Actions

Now that the bot has been successfully created, GitHub Actions can authenticate with the Teleport cluster using their
GitHub-provided identity.

You now need to configure your GitHub Action pipeline.

### `teleport-actions/auth`

In the GitHub workflows directory of your repo (`.github/workflows/`) create a new workflow YAML file,
in this case `actionstest.yml`, that will reflect the action you'd like to configure. This guide will create an action that
will both list nodes within the cluster using `tsh ls`, as well as write the commit SHA that triggered the workflow to
a file on a node. To create this configuration, use the following YAML file:

```yaml
# This is a basic workflow to help you get started.
# It will take the following action whenever a push is made to the "main" branch.
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  demo:
    permissions:
      # The "id-token: write" permission is required or Machine ID will not be able to authenticate with the cluster.
      id-token: write
      contents: read
    # The name of the workflow, and the Linux distro to be used to perform the required steps.
    name: guide-demo
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Fetch Teleport binaries
        uses: teleport-actions/setup@v1
        with:
          version: (=teleport.version=)
      - name: Fetch credentials using Machine ID
        id: auth
        uses: teleport-actions/auth@v2
        with:
          # Use the address of the auth/proxy server for your own cluster.
          proxy: example.domain:443
          # Use the name of the join token resource you created in step 1.
          token: example-bot
          # Specify the length of time that the generated credentials should be
          # valid for. This is optional and defaults to "1h"
          certificate-ttl: 1h
          # Enable the submission of anonymous usage telemetry.
          anonymous-telemetry: 1
      - name: List nodes
        # Enters a command from the cluster, in this case "tsh ls" using Machine ID credentials to list remote SSH nodes.
        run: tsh ls
      - name: Write file to remote
        # Enters a command from the cluster, in this case "tsh ssh" using Machine ID credentials to gain SSH access to an SSH node, and then write the commit hash to the "github_run_log" file.
        # Ensure that `username` matches the username of a remote SSH username, and that hostname matches an SSH host name that is a part of the Teleport cluster configured for access.
        run: tsh ssh username@hostname "echo $GITHUB_SHA >> ~/github_run_log"
```

`anonymous-telemetry` enables the submission of anonymous usage telemetry. This
helps us shape the future development of `tbot`. You can disable this by
omitting this.

Add, commit, and push your changes to the `main` branch of the repository.

Navigate to the **Actions** tab of your GitHub repository in your web browser.
Select the **Workflow** that has now been created and triggered by the change,
and select the `guide-demo` job. The GitHub Actions workflow may take some time
to complete, and will resemble the following once successful.

![GitHub Actions](../../../img/machine-id/github-actions.png)

Expand the **List nodes** step of the action, and the output will
list all nodes in the cluster, from the perspective of the
Machine ID bot using the command `tsh ls`.

### `teleport-actions/kubernetes`

### Do It Yourself

Whilst we offer off-the-shelf GitHub Actions to use, it is also possible to manually configure `tbot` to use the
`github` join method and produce the outputs that you desire. This may be useful in more specialist situations.

Create `tbot.yaml` within your repository:

```yaml
version: v2
auth_server: example.teleport.sh:443
onboarding:
  join_method: gitlab
  token: example-bot
oneshot: true
storage:
  type: memory
# outputs will be filled in during the completion of an access guide.
outputs: []
```

Replace:

- `example.teleport.sh:443` with the address of your Teleport Proxy or
Auth Server. Prefer using the address of a Teleport Proxy.
- `example-bot` with the name of the token you created in the second step

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/configure-outputs.mdx!)

## A note on security implications and risk

Once `teleport-actions/auth` has been used in a workflow job, all successive
steps in that job will have access to the credentials which grant access to your
Teleport cluster as the bot. Where possible, run as few steps as necessary after
this action has been used. It may be a good idea to break your workflow up into
multiple jobs in order to segregate these credentials from other code running in
your CI/CD pipeline.

Most importantly, ensure that the role you assign to your GitHub Actions bot has
access to only the resources in your Teleport cluster that your CI/CD needs to
interact with.
