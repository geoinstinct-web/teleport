  Machine ID for GitLab is available starting from Teleport `v12.2`.
</Details>

In this guide, you will use Teleport Machine ID to allow a GitLab pipeline to
securely connect to a Teleport SSH node without the need for long-lived secrets.

Machine ID for GitLab works with GitLab's cloud-hosted option and with
self-hosted GitLab installations. **The minimum supported GitLab version is
15.7**.

This mitigates the risk of long-lived secrets such as passwords or SSH private
keys being exfiltrated from your GitLab organization and provides many of
the other benefits of Teleport such as auditing and finely-grained access
control.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- A running instance of the Teleport SSH Service registered with your Teleport
cluster. For instructions on setting this up, see the [Getting Started
Guide](../../server-access/introduction.mdx). The SSH node must include a user
you want to grant access to. In this guide, we will call the SSH node `my-node`
and the user `ci-user`. Replace these with values appropriate to your setup.
- A GitLab project to connect to Teleport. This can either be on GitLab's
cloud-hosted offering (gitlab.com) or on a self-hosted GitLab instance. **When
using a self-hosted GitLab instance, your Teleport Auth Server must be able to
connect to your GitLab instance and your GitLab instance must be configured with
a valid TLS certificate.**

## Step 1/4. Create a join token

To allow GitLab CI to authenticate to your Teleport cluster, you'll first need
to create a join token. A GitLab join token contains allow rules that describe
which pipelines can use that token in order to join the Teleport cluster. A rule
can contain multiple fields, and any pipeline that matches all of the fields
within a single rule is granted access.

In this example, you will create a token with a rule that grants access to any
GitLab CI job within a specific GitLab project. Determine the fully qualified
path of your GitLab project. This will include your username (or group) and the
name of your project, e.g `my-user/my-project`.

Create a file named `gitlab-token.yaml`. Ensure you substitute any values as
suggested by the comments in this example:

```yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  name: example-bot
spec:
  # The Bot role indicates that this token grants access to a bot user, rather
  # than allowing a node to join. This role is built in to Teleport.
  roles: [Bot]
  join_method: gitlab
  # The bot_name indicates which bot user this token grants access to. This
  # should match the name of the bot that you create in step 2.
  bot_name: example
  gitlab:
    # domain should be the domain of your GitLab instance. If you are using
    # GitLab's cloud hosted offering, omit this field entirely.
    domain: gitlab.example.com
    # allow specifies rules that control which GitLab tokens will be accepted
    # by Teleport. Tokens not matching any allow rule will be denied.
    allow:
        # project_path should be the fully qualified path of your GitLab
        # project that you determined earlier. This will grant access to any
        # GitLab CI run in that project.
      - project_path: my-user/my-project
```

You can find a full list of the token configuration options for GitLab joining
on the
[GitLab CI reference page.](../reference/gitlab.mdx#gitlab-join-token)

Apply this to your Teleport cluster using `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl create -f gitlab-token.yaml
```

## Step 2/4. Create a Machine ID bot

With the join token created, the next step is to create the Machine ID bot that
the token will grant access to.

In this example, the bot is given the preset `access` role. In a production
environment, the principle of least privilege should be applied and you should
create a role that grants the bot access to the precise resources that will be
needed in your CI/CD pipeline.

From your workstation enter the following command, replacing the`ci-user`
value with a Linux user on the host that you want your GitHub Actions flow to
be able to connect to:

```code
$ tctl bots add example --roles=example-bot --token=example-bot
```

## Step 3/4. Configure a GitLab Pipeline

With the bot and join token created, you can now create a GitLab pipeline that
uses these to access a node in your cluster.

Create `tbot.yaml` within your repository:

```yaml
version: v2
auth_server: example.teleport.sh:443
onboarding:
  join_method: gitlab
  token: example-bot
oneshot: true
storage:
  type: memory
# outputs will be filled in during the completion of an access guide.
outputs: []
```

Replace:

- `example.teleport.sh:443` with the address of your Teleport Proxy or
  Auth Server. Prefer using the address of a Teleport Proxy.
- `example-bot` with the name of the token you created in the second step

Create a file called `.gitlab-ci.yml` in the root of your repository. Replace:
- `teleport.example.com` with the name of your Teleport cluster
- `teleport.example.com:443` with the public address and port of your Teleport
  Proxy
- `my-node` and `ci-user` with the user and host you wish to connect to

```yaml
stages:
  - deploy

deploy-job:
  stage: deploy
  id_tokens:
    # See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/secrets/id_token_authentication.html
    # for further explanation of the id_tokens configuration.
    TBOT_GITLAB_JWT:
      # An environment variable named TBOT_GITLAB_JWT must exist and contain
      # an ID token with an audience that matches your Teleport cluster's name.
      aud: teleport.example.com
  script:
    - cd /tmp
    - 'curl -O https://cdn.teleport.dev/teleport-v(=teleport.version=)-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz'
    - tar -xvf teleport-v(=teleport.version=)-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz
    - sudo ./teleport/install
    - 'tbot start -c tbot.yaml'
```

Commit and push these two files to the repository.

Check your GitLab CI status, and examine the log results from the commit for
failure.
