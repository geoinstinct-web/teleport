title: Deploying Machine ID on GCP
description: How to install and configure Machine ID on a GCP VM
---

This page contains relevant background information and specific steps for
deploying Machine ID on Google Cloud Platform.

## Background

### The `gcp` join method

TODO: Introduce GCP IAM Concepts and overview of the join method

### Google Kubernetes Engine

Whilst the guide on this page focuses explicitly on deploying Machine ID on a
GCP Virtual Machine, it is also possible to use the `gcp` join method with
workloads (e.g Pods) running on a GKE Kubernetes cluster.

It is a requirement that
[GCP Workload Identity](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity)
has been configured for the cluster and the Kubernetes service account that will
be used by the `tbot` pod.

See the [Kubernetes platform guide](../kubernetes.mdx) for further guidance
on deploying Machine ID as a workload on Kubernetes.

## Guide

This guide will...

### Before you start

### Step 1/3. Assign a GCP Service Account to a VM

### Step 2/3. Create a role and bot user

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/blank-role.mdx!)

### Step 3/3. Configure `tbot`

### Step 4/4. Configure Outputs

Follow one of the [access guides](../access-guides.mdx) to configure an output
that meets your access needs.

## Next steps

- Follow the [access guides](../access-guides.mdx) to finish configuring `tbot` for
  your environment.
- Read the [configuration reference](../reference/configuration.mdx) to explore
  all the available configuration options.
