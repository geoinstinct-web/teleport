title: Deploying Machine ID on AWS
description: How to install and configure Machine ID on an AWS EC2 instance
---

This page contains relevant background information and specific steps for
deploying Machine ID on Amazon Web Services.

## Background

### The `iam` join method

TODO: Brief overview of how the join method works for this platform.

### Elastic Kubernetes Service

Whilst the guide on this page focuses explicitly on deploying Machine ID on an
EC2 instance, it is also possible to use the `iam` join method with
workloads (e.g Pods) running on an EKS Kubernetes cluster.

It is a requirement that
[IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html)
has been configured for the cluster and the Kubernetes service account that will
be used by the `tbot` pod.

See the [Kubernetes platform guide](kubernetes.mdx) for further guidance
on deploying Machine ID as a workload on Kubernetes.

## Guide

This guide will...

### Before you start

### Step 1/3. Assign a GCP Service Account to a VM

### Step 2/3. Create a role and bot user

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/blank-role.mdx!)

Create `bot-token.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  # name will be specified in the `tbot` to use this token
  name: example-bot
spec:
  roles: [Bot]
  # bot_name will match the name of the bot created later in this guide.
  bot_name: example
  join_method: iam
  # Restrict the AWS account and (optionally) ARN that can use this token.
  # This information can be obtained from running the
  # "aws sts get-caller-identity" command from the CLI.
  allow:
    - aws_account: "111111111111"
      aws_arn: "arn:aws:sts::111111111111:assumed-role/teleport-bot-role/i-*"
```

Use `tctl` to apply this file:

```code
$ tctl create -f bot-token.yaml
```

### Step 3/3. Configure `tbot`

### Step 4/4. Configure Outputs

Follow one of the [access guides](../access-guides.mdx) to configure an output
that meets your access needs.

## Next steps

- Follow the [access guides](../access-guides.mdx) to finish configuring `tbot` for
  your environment.
- Read the [configuration reference](../reference/configuration.mdx) to explore
  all the available configuration options.
