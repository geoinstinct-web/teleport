description: How to install and configure Machine ID on an AWS EC2 instance
---

This page contains relevant background information and specific steps for
deploying Machine ID on Amazon Web Services.

## Background

### The `iam` join method

TODO: Brief overview of how the join method works for this platform.

### Elastic Kubernetes Service

Whilst the guide on this page focuses explicitly on deploying Machine ID on an
EC2 instance, it is also possible to use the `iam` join method with
workloads (e.g Pods) running on an EKS Kubernetes cluster.

It is a requirement that
[IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html)
has been configured for the cluster and the Kubernetes service account that will
be used by the `tbot` pod.

See the [Kubernetes platform guide](../kubernetes.mdx) for further guidance
on deploying Machine ID as a workload on Kubernetes.

## Guide

This guide will...

### Before you start

### Step 1/3. Assign a GCP Service Account to a VM

### Step 2/3. Create a role and bot user

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/blank-role.mdx!)

### Step 3/3. Configure `tbot`

### Step 4/4. Configure Outputs

Follow one of the [access guides](../access-guides.mdx) to configure an output
that meets your access needs.

## Next steps

- Follow the [access guides](../access-guides.mdx) to finish configuring `tbot` for
  your environment.
- Read the [configuration reference](../reference/configuration.mdx) to explore
  all the available configuration options.
