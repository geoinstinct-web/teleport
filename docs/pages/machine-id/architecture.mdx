This section provides an overview of Teleport Machine ID's inner workings.

A more in-depth specification of the workings of Machine ID can be found in
[the Request For Discussion.](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0064-bot-for-cert-renewals.md)

## Role Impersonation

At the core of Machine ID is the concept of role impersonation.

Role Impersonation allows a user to generate credentials with a set of requested
roles. The user does not have to hold these roles, but must have been granted 
permission to impersonate them. The impersonated credentials still include
the username of the user that generated them, so actions can be attributed to 
the user.

These credentials can then be used to complete any action that is allowed by the
role's configured permissions. 

In the case of Machine ID, the bot user is assigned a bot role, which includes 
permissions to impersonate the roles that the user has configured.

## `tbot`

`tbot` is the binary that acts as the agent for Machine ID.

On initial load, `tbot` uses the configured join method to obtain a set of
credentials for the bot user from the Teleport Auth Service. It can then use
these credentials to communicate with the Teleport auth service as the bot.

On a configured regular period `tbot` then:

- Renews these bot user credentials
- For each configured destination:
  - Obtains role impersonated credentials from the auth service using its
    bot user credentials.
  - Outputs these role impersonated credentials in the configured formats.

Concurrently to this, `tbot` monitors the Teleport certificate authorities to
detect certificate rotations. When this occurs, it triggers additional renewals
to ensure that `tbot` has certificates signed by the newly rotated certificate
authority.
