## Which Teleport features are currently supported by Machine ID?

Broadly, Machine ID currently supports the following Teleport features:
 * [Server Access](../server-access/introduction.mdx)
 * [Database Access](../database-access/introduction.mdx)
 * [Kubernetes Access](../kubernetes-access/introduction.mdx) (*in Teleport v10.1*)
 * [Application Access](../application-access/introduction.mdx) (*in Teleport v10.1*)
   * Note: [AWS Console](../application-access/guides/aws-console.mdx) and API access is currently unsupported.
 * [Teleport API Access](../api/introduction.mdx)

These features are supported in Teleport OSS, Teleport Enterprise, and Teleport
Cloud.

The following features are **not** supported by Machine ID bots:
 * [Desktop Access](../desktop-access/introduction.mdx)
 * [User Impersonation](../access-controls/guides/impersonation.mdx): Machine 
   ID uses Role Impersonation which cannot be combined with User Impersonation.
 * Multifactor authentication like [WebAuthn](../access-controls/guides/webauthn.mdx) and [Passwordless](../access-controls/guides/passwordless.mdx)
 * [AWS Console Access](../application-access/guides/aws-console.mdx)


## Can Machine ID be used within CI/CD jobs?

Yes, however it depends on your CI/CD provider. It's currently a good fit in the
following situations:

 * Either short-lived or long-lived tasks run on AWS instances using AWS IAM
   joining.
 * Long-lived worker nodes, like self-hosted Jenkins workers, using token-based
   joining.

We are working to support SaaS-based CI/CD providers like GitHub Actions in the
the near future, but cannot currently recommend using Machine ID on these
providers.
