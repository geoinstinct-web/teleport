description: An explanation of the telemetry collected by Machine ID
---

This document explains what telemetry is collected by the Machine ID `tbot`
agent, why we want to collect this telemetry and how to opt in or out.

## Why?

Machine ID is an emerging part of the Teleport product and it's helpful for us
to be able to identify the kinds of use-cases people are using it for. This
allows us to prioritise more common usages. Whilst we try to collect this sort
of information by talking to users directly, having a more general overview of
the product in the wild helps us make even more informed decisions and avoid
our decisions being solely influenced by a select few users.

## Anonymous telemetry

Anonymous telemetry is currently the only mode supported by `tbot`. This means
that the collected data does not include anything which identifies:

- The specific machine `tbot` is running on,
- The cluster `tbot` is connecting to,
- The hosts, application, databases and kubernetes clusters `tbot` connects to,
- The user that has configured `tbot`.

Whilst we do not collect data which uniquely identifies the specific machine
`tbot` is running on, we may collect general information about the architecture
and operating system installed on the machine.

We do not assign a unique ID that identifies your `tbot` deployment across
multiple starts. This means it is not possible for us to determine how long
`tbot` has been installed on a machine or track changes made to a `tbot`
configuration on a specific host over time.

We do assign a unique ID that identifies events that originate from a single
`tbot` start (you may hear this be referred to as a "session"). This allows
us to tie together multiple events and determine how long they occur after
`tbot` has started.

### Opt-out/opt-in

Anonymous telemetry in `tbot` is strictly opt-in.

To opt in to this telemetry, set the opt-in environment variable to `1`:

```sh
export TELEPORT_ANONYMOUS_TELEMETRY=1
tbot start ...
```

You can use the same environment variable to explicitly opt-out of this
telemetry by setting the value to `0`:

```sh
export TELEPORT_ANONYMOUS_TELEMETRY=0
tbot start ...
```

If this environment variable is not configured, `tbot` defaults to not
collecting anonymous telemetry.
