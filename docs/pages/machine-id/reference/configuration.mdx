title: Machine ID Configuration Reference
description: Configuration reference for Teleport Machine ID.
---

The following snippet shows full YAML configuration of the Machine ID client
`tbot`. Assuming the file is written to `tbot.yaml`, it can be used with
`tbot -c /etc/tbot.yaml`.

```yaml
# `version` specifies the version of the configuration file in use. `v2` is the
# most recent and should be used for all new bots. The rest of this example
# is in the `v2` schema.
version: v2

# `debug` enables verbose logging to stderr. If unspecified, this defaults to
# false.
debug: true

# `auth_server `specifies the Proxy or Auth Server that `tbot` should connect
# to. It is recommended to use the address of your Teleport Proxy, or, if using
# Teleport Cloud, the address of your Teleport Cloud instance.
auth_server: "teleport.example.com:443" # or "example.teleport.sh:443" for Teleport Cloud

# certificate_ttl specifies how long certificates generated by `tbot` should
# live for. It should be a positive, numeric value with an `m` (for minutes) or
# `h` (for hours) suffix. By default, this value is `1h`.
certificate_ttl: "1h"

# `renewal_interval` specifies how often `tbot` should aim to renew the
# outputs it has generated. It should be a positive, numeric value with an
# `m` (for minutes) or `h` (for hours) suffix. The default value is `20m`.
# This value must be lower than `certificate_ttl`.
# This value is ignored when using `tbot` is running in one-shot mode.
renewal_interval: "20m"

# `oneshot` is an option that when set to true, configures `tbot` to exit
# immediately after generating the outputs.  The default value is `false`.
# This is useful in ephemeral
# environments, like CI/CD.
oneshot: false

# `onboarding` is a group of configuration options that control how `tbot` will
# authenticate with the Teleport cluster.
onboarding:
  # `token` specifies which join token, configured in the Teleport cluster,
  # should be used to join the Teleport cluster.
  #
  # This can also be an absolute path to a file containing the value you wish
  # to be used.
  # File path example:
  # token: /var/lib/teleport/tokenjoin
  token: "00000000000000000000000000000000"

  # `join_method` specifies the join method associated with the token
  # specified above. This should match the value configured in the `token`
  # resource you have created before starting the bot.
  #
  # Support values include:
  # - `token`
  # - `azure`
  # - `circleci`
  # - `github`
  # - `gitlab`
  # - `iam`
  join_method: "token"

  # `ca_pins` is used to validate the identity of the Teleport Auth Server on
  # first connect. This should not be specified when using Teleport Cloud or
  # connecting via a Teleport Proxy.
  ca_pins:
    - "(=presets.ca_pin=)"
    - "(=presets.ca_pin=)"

  # `ca_path` is used to validate the identity of the Teleport Auth Server on
  # first connect. This should not be specified when using Teleport Cloud or
  # connecting via a Teleport Proxy.
  ca_path: "/path/to/ca.pem"

# `storage` specifies the destination that `tbot` should use to store its
# internal state. This state is sensitive, and you should ensure that the
# destination you specify here can only be accessed by `tbot`.
#
# If unspecified, storage will be set to a directory destination with a path
# of `/var/lib/teleport/bot`.
#
# See the full list of supported destinations and their configuration options
# under the Destinations section of this reference page.
storage:
  type: directory
  path: /var/lib/teleport/bot

# `outputs` specifies what artifacts `tbot` should generate and renew when it
# runs.
#
# See the full list of supported outputs and their configuration options
# under the Outputs section of this reference page.
outputs:
  - type: identity
    destination:
      type: directory
      path: /opt/machine-id
```

If no configuration file is provided, a simple configuration is used based
on the provided CLI flags. Given the following sample CLI from
`tctl bots add ...`:

```code
$ tbot start \
   --destination-dir=./tbot-user \
   --token=00000000000000000000000000000000 \
   --ca-pin=(=presets.ca_pin=) \
   --auth-server=auth.example.com:3025
```

it uses a configuration equivalent to the following:

```yaml
auth_server: auth.example.com:3025

onboarding:
  join_method: "token"
  token: "(=presets.tokens.first=)"
  ca_pins:
    - "(=presets.ca_pin=)"

storage:
  type: directory
  path: /var/lib/teleport/bot

outputs:
  - type: identity
    destination:
      type: directory
      path: ./tbot-user
```

## Outputs

Outputs define what actions `tbot` should take when it runs. They describe
what format of certificates should be generated, with what roles and to what
destination they should be written.

There are multiple types of output, select the one that is most appropriate for
your intended use-case.

### `identity`

The `identity` output can be used to authenticate:

- SSH access to your Teleport nodes, using `tsh`, openssh and tools like
  ansible
- Administrative actions against your cluster using tools like `tsh` or `tctl`
- Management of Teleport resources using the Teleport Terraform provider
- Access to the Teleport API using the Teleport Go SDK

See the [Getting Started guide](../getting-started.mdx) to see the `identity`
output used in context.

```yaml
# `type` specifies the type of the output. For the identity output, this will
# always be `identity`.
type: identity
# `destination` specifies where the output should write any generated artifacts
# such as certificates and configuration files.
#
# See the full list of supported destinations and their configuration options
# under the Destinations section of this reference page.
destination:
  type: directory
  path: /opt/machine-id
# `roles` specifies which roles should be included in the certificates generated
# by the output. These roles must be roles for which the bot has been granted
# permission to impersonate.
#
# When unspecified, all roles the bot is allowed to impersonate will be used.
roles:
  - editor
```

### `application`

The `application` output is used to generate credentials that can be used to
access applications that have been configured with Teleport Application Access.

See the [Machine ID with Application Access guide](../guides/applications.mdx)
to see the `application` output used in context.

```yaml
# `type` specifies the type of the output. For the application output, this will
# always be `application`.
type: application
# `app_name` specifies the application name, as configured in your Teleport
# cluster, that `tbot` should generate credentials for.
# This field must be specified.
app_name: grafana

# `destination` specifies where the output should write any generated artifacts
# such as certificates and configuration files.
#
# See the full list of supported destinations and their configuration options
# under the Destinations section of this reference page.
destination:
  type: directory
  path: /opt/machine-id
# `roles` specifies which roles should be included in the certificates generated
# by the output. These roles must be roles for which the bot has been granted
# permission to impersonate.
#
# When unspecified, all roles the bot is allowed to impersonate will be used.
roles:
  - editor
```

### `database`

The `database` output is used to generate credentials that can be used to
access databases that have been configured with Teleport Database Access.

See the [Machine ID with Database Access guide](../guides/databases.mdx)
to see the `database` output used in context.

```yaml
# `type` specifies the type of the output. For the database output, this will
# always be `database`.
type: database
# `service` is the name of the database service, as configured in Teleport,
# that the output should generate credentials for. This field must be specified.
service: my-postgres-server
# `database` is the name of the specific database on the specified database
# service to generate credentials for. This field may not need to be specified
# when using database types that do not have individual databases.
database: my-database
# `username` is the name of the user on the specified database service to
# generate credentials for. This field may not need to be specified
# when using database types that do not have users.
username: my-user
# `format` specifies what format the output artifacts should take. If
# unspecified, a sensible default is used. See the table titled "Supported
# formats" below for the full list of supported values.
format: tls

# `destination` specifies where the output should write any generated artifacts
# such as certificates and configuration files.
#
# See the full list of supported destinations and their configuration options
# under the Destinations section of this reference page.
destination:
  type: directory
  path: /opt/machine-id
# `roles` specifies which roles should be included in the certificates generated
# by the output. These roles must be roles for which the bot has been granted
# permission to impersonate.
#
# When unspecified, all roles the bot is allowed to impersonate will be used.
roles:
  - editor
```

#### Supported formats

| `format`      | Description                          |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| Unspecified   | Provides a certificate in `tlscert`, a private key in `key` and the CA in `teleport-database-ca.crt`. This is compatible with most clients and databases. |
| `mongo`       | Provides `mongo.crt` and `mongo.cas`. This is designed for compatability with MongoDB clients. |
| `cockroach`   | Provides `cockroach/node.key`, `cockroach/node.crt`, and `cockroach/ca.crt`. This is designed for compatability with CockroachDB clients. |
| `tls`         | Provides `tls.key`, `tls.crt`, and `tls.cas`. This is for generic clients that require the specific file extensions. |

### `kubernetes`

The `kubernetes` output is used to generate credentials that can be used to
access Kubernetes clusters that have been configured with Teleport Kubernetes
Access.

It outputs a `kubeconfig.yaml` in the output destination, which can be used
with `kubectl`.

See the [Machine ID with Kubernetes Access guide](../guides/kubernetes.mdx)
to see the `kubernetes` output used in context.

```yaml
# `type` specifies the type of the output. For the kubernetes output, this will
# always be `kubernetes`.
type: kubernetes
# `kubernetes_cluster` is the name of the Kubernetes cluster, as configured in
# Teleport, that the output should generate credentials and a kubeconfig for.
# This field must be specified.
kubernetes_cluster: my-cluster

# `destination` specifies where the output should write any generated artifacts
# such as certificates and configuration files.
#
# See the full list of supported destinations and their configuration options
# under the Destinations section of this reference page.
destination:
  type: directory
  path: /opt/machine-id
# `roles` specifies which roles should be included in the certificates generated
# by the output. These roles must be roles for which the bot has been granted
# permission to impersonate.
#
# When unspecified, all roles the bot is allowed to impersonate will be used.
roles:
  - editor
```

### `ssh_host`

```yaml
type: ssh_host

# `destination` specifies where the output should write any generated artifacts
# such as certificates and configuration files.
#
# See the full list of supported destinations and their configuration options
# under the Destinations section of this reference page.
destination:
  type: directory
  path: /opt/machine-id
# `roles` specifies which roles should be included in the certificates generated
# by the output. These roles must be roles for which the bot has been granted
# permission to impersonate.
#
# When unspecified, all roles the bot is allowed to impersonate will be used.
roles:
  - editor
```

## Destinations

A destination is somewhere that `tbot` can read and write artifacts.

Destinations are used in two places in the `tbot` configuration:

- Specifying where `tbot` should store its internal state
- Specifying where an output should write the generated artifacts to

Destinations come in multiple types, usually the `directory` type will be most
appropriate.

### `directory`

The `directory` destination type stores artifacts as files within a specified
directory. This is usually the correct destination type to use.

```yaml
# For a directory destination, type will always be `directory`.
type: directory

# The path to the folder in which to read and write files.
path: /opt/machine-id

# Configure symlink attack prevention. Requires Linux 5.6+.
# Possible values:
#   * try-secure (default): Attempt to securely read and write certificates
#     without symlinks, but fall back (with a warning) to insecure read
#     and write if the host doesn't support this.
#   * secure: Attempt to securely read and write certificates, with a hard error
#     if unsupported.
#   * insecure: Quietly allow symlinks in paths.
symlinks: try-secure
# Configure ACL use. Requires Linux with a file system that supports ACLs.
# Possible values:
#   * try (default on Linux): Attempt to use ACLs, warn at runtime if ACLs
#     are configured but invalid.
#   * off (default on non-Linux): Do not attempt to use ACLs.
#   * required: Always use ACLs, produce a hard error at runtime if ACLs
#     are invalid.
acls: try
```

### `memory`

The `memory` destination type stores artifacts within the process memory. This
means when the process exits, nothing will be persisted. This destination type
is most suitable for ephemeral environments, but can also be used for testing.

Configuration:

```yaml
# For a memory destination, type will always be `memory`.
type: memory
```
