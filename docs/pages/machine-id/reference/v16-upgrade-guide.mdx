title: Machine ID v16 Upgrade Guide
description: Upgrade instructions for Machine ID in Teleport 16.0
---

Teleport 16.0 introduces a number of changes to Machine ID, some of which
may require action on your part.

You may need to take action if:

- You use Machine ID with OpenSSH or OpenSSH based clients (e.g. Ansible).

## Changes OpenSSH support and the `tbot proxy ssh` command

When using Machine ID with an OpenSSH client, an `ssh_config` is generated and
used to configure the OpenSSH client.

Within the `ssh_config`, the `ProxyCommand` directive specifies a special
command to be used to connect to the target host.

Historically, this command would be `tbot proxy ssh`.

We have now introduced a new command: `tbot ssh-proxy-command`. This has
a number of benefits:

- `tsh` is no longer required to be installed on the machine.
- The amount of CPU and memory used during a connection is significantly reduced.
- The time taken to establish a connection is significantly reduced.

This command was introduced in a Teleport 15 release, and from Teleport 16.0
will become used by default in the generated `ssh_config`. From Teleport 17.0,
the `tbot proxy ssh` command will no longer be supported and will be removed.

### Actions required

If you are using Machine ID with OpenSSH or OpenSSH based clients, you may need
to take action.

#### Using the default `ssh_config`

If you are using the default generated `ssh_config`, then no explicit action
should be necessary.

From 16.0, the new command will be used. There should be no changes
in behaviour. We do recommend that you perform a test-run when updating to
ensure that everything is working as expected.

If upon upgrading to 16.0, you do not observe the behaviour you are expecting
then you can temporarily revert to the old behaviour by TODO

#### Using a modified `ssh_config`

If you have modified the `ssh_config` and therefore do not use the default
`ssh_config` generated by `tbot`, then you will need to manually update the
file. You must do this before 17.0, but we recommend doing this in 16.0 to
benefit from the performance improvements.

To update your modified `ssh_config`, we recommend running an instance of `tbot`
as you would usually configure it. This will generate a new `ssh_config`.
Carefully inspect the `ProxyCommand` directive, and copy the new command to
your modified `ssh_config`.

You can find a full list of the parameters available for the
`tbot ssh-proxy-command` on the [CLI reference page](/TODO).
