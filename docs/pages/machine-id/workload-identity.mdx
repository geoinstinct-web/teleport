description: Teleport's Workload Identity for SPIFFE

<Admonition type="tip" title="Preview">
Teleport Workload Identity is currently in Preview. We are actively working on
improving the feature and would love to hear your feedback. We currently do
not recommend using this feature in production.
</Admonition>

Teleport's Workload Identity is a solution for issuing flexible short-lived
identities intended for workloads. It is compatible with the industry-standard
SPIFFE specification meaning that it can be used in place of other SPIFFE
compatible identity providers.

Teleport's Workload Identity brings a number of Teleport features you are
already familiar with, such as:

- Rich auditing
- .. TODO: Why use our SPIFFE implementation? ..

## Overview

### What is SPIFFE?

SPIFFE (Secure Production Identity Framework For Everyone) is a set of standards
for securely identifying workloads.

SPIFFE sets out:

- A format for uniquely specifying an identity, the SPIFFE ID.
- Standards for encoding the SPIFFE ID into verifiable documents, the SVID.
- Processes for securely validating a SVID as legitimate.
- A set of APIs that workloads can use to request SVIDS, the
  Workload Identity API.

The open nature and popularity of SPIFFE make it a great choice as a foundation
for workload identity within your infrastructure. It is supported as an identity
source by a number of popular tools (such as Linkerd and Istio) and a number
of off-the-shelf SDKs exist for implementing SPIFFE directly into your own
services.
