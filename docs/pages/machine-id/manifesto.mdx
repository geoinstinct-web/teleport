title: Machine ID Manifesto
description: A manifesto for Trusted Machine Computing
---

As time goes on, machines and services are doing more and more impactful and
privileged work. Services are increasingly communicating with each other across
network and company boundaries. AI agents are getting increasingly common and
are becoming more autonomous and powerful at an accelerating pace.

On the other side, services and machines are increasingly a target of attacks,
with hackers trying to get access to critical systems, stealing API keys and
exploiting compromises to get access to critical data and control over
mission-critical systems.

These challenges create an urgent need for trusted computing that rests on three
pillars.

### Strong identity-based authentication

Legacy systems rely on shared secrets, such as API keys, to authenticate.

Instead, each service and machine should have a strong, cryptographic identity
(e.g an X.509 certificate) that is verifiable by other services inside and
outside the organization. This identity should be used for authentication and
form the basis of authorization decisions.

### Trusted execution

Before an identity is issued, the integrity and authenticity of the machine
should be verified. The chain of trust of the code running on the machine must
be verified to guard against tampering prior to startup, and the code should be
executed in a trusted execution environment to prevent tampering at runtime.

### Complete visibility and unified access control

We need a unified way to reason and express the properties of the entire
ecosystem of services: what data they have access to and why, what permissions
they have, and what data have they accessed and modified with tamper-proof
evidence and trial of their execution.

Together, these three pillars create a strong foundation for AI, automations and
other workloads running together in a predictable way that is secure and
possible to reason about and maintain.

Teleport Workload & Machine Identity is on a mission to make this vision a
reality.
