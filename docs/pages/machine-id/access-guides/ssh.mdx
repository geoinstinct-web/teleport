Teleport Server Access protects and controls SSH access to servers. Machine ID
can be used to grant machines secure, short-lived access to these servers.

In this guide, you will configure `tbot` to produce credentials that can be
used to access a Linux server enrolled in Teleport Server Access. The guide
will cover access using Teleports CLI `tsh` as well as the OpenSSH SSH client.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- If you have not already connected your server to Teleport, follow
  the [Server Access Getting Started Guide](../../application-access/getting-started.mdx).

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

- `tbot` must already be installed and configured on the machine that will
  connect to Linux hosts with SSH. For more information, see the
  [platform guides](../platform-guides.mdx).
