(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/v2-config-warning.mdx!)

Teleport Kubernetes Access protects and controls access to Kubernetes
clusters. Machine ID can be used to grant machines secure, short-lived
access to these clusters.

In this guide, you will configure `tbot` to produce credentials that can be
used to access a cluster configured in Teleport Kubernetes Access.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- If you have not already connected your Kubernetes cluster to Teleport, follow
  the [Kubernetes Access Getting Started Guide](../../kubernetes-access/getting-started.mdx).

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/kubernetes-machineidnote.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- To interact with the connected Kubernetes cluster, your client system
  will need to have `kubectl` installed. See the
  [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) for
  installation instructions.
- `tbot` must already be installed and configured on the machine that will
  access Kubernetes clusters. For more information, see the
  [platform guides](../platform-guides.mdx).

## Step 1/3. Configure Teleport and Kubernetes RBAC

First, determine what level of access you wish the machine to have in your
Kubernetes cluster. When forwarding requests to the Kubernetes API, Teleport
associates it with a group. This group should be used to configure a
Kubernetes RoleBinding that will grant it privileges.

<Details
title="Create a Kubernetes ClusterRoleBinding"
opened={true}

If you don't have an existing Kubernetes `Role` or `RoleBinding` to grant your
Machine ID bot, create one as follows.

Kubernetes clusters come with pre-made roles such as `view` and `edit`. You may
view these preexisting roles by running the following:
```code
$ kubectl get clusterrole
```

If you'd prefer to create a role of your own, the following command can be used
to create a rule with narrow access to certain resources types in the
`example-namespace` namespace:
```code
## This creates a role allowing `get` and `list` on pods and deployments.
$ kubectl create role example-role \
  --namespace=example-namespace \
  --verb=get,list \
  --resource=pods,deployments
```

Next, create a role binding to connect the bot to your role. You may bind either
the bot's mapped `User` or mapped `Group` to a role, however it must have been
granted the matching `User` or `Group` via a Teleport role above:

```code
## This binds the new role to the group `example`
$ kubectl create rolebinding example-rolebinding-group \
  --namespace=demo \
  --role=example-role \
  --group=example
## Alternatively, this binds the new role to the user `alice`
$ kubectl create rolebinding example-rolebinding-user \
  --namespace=demo \
  --role=example-role \
  --user=alice
## If binding to a ClusterRole like `view`, instead run the following:
$ kubectl create rolebinding example-rolebinding-user \
  --namespace=demo \
  --clusterrole=view \
  --user=alice
```

You can grant cluster-wide access to your bot user by instead creating `ClusterRole` and
`ClusterRoleBinding` resources, which are not namespaced and use an otherwise
identical syntax.
</Details>

First, Teleport must be configured to allow the credentials produced by the bot
to access the Kubernetes cluster.

If you have followed an access guide, you will have created a role and granted
the bot the ability to impersonate it already. This role just needs to have the
additional privileges added to it.

Use `tctl edit role/example-bot` to add the following rule to the role:

```yaml
spec:
  allow:
    kubernetes_labels:
      '*': '*'
    kubernetes_resources:
    - kind: pod
      namespace: "*"
      name: "*"
    kubernetes_groups:
    - editor
```

Be sure to configure the `allow` fields to match your environment:

- `kubernetes_labels` must be specified to allow access to a matching
  Kubernetes cluster in your Teleport environment.

- Each item in `kubernetes_resources` must match the namespace and name of a
  Kubernetes resource that you would like users with `machine-id-kube-role` to
  access. Currently, Teleport only supports the `pod` kind. In the
  configuration above, this role can access all pods in all namespaces.

- One (or both) of `kubernetes_groups` and `kubernetes_users` must be specified
  to so that the bot user may be mapped to a Kubernetes user and/or group.

  If only `kubernetes_groups` is set, `kubernetes_users` will be set to the
  bot's username by default.

  The user and group values entered here are relayed directly to the Kubernetes
  cluster as incoming user and group names. Kubernetes users and groups do not
  need to be created in advance, but do need to match one or more
  `RoleBindings` for the bot user to have any permissions on the target
  Kubernetes cluster.

## Step 2/3. Configure the `tbot` output

Now, `tbot` needs to be configured with an output that will produce the
credentials and configuration files needed for Kubernetes Access. To do this,
the `kubernetes` output type is used.

The specific Kubernetes cluster you want the credentials to have access to must
be specified using the `kubernetes_cluster` field.

Modify your `tbot` configuration to add a `kubernetes` output:

```yaml
outputs:
  - type: kubernetes
    # specify the name of the kubernetes cluster you wish the credentials to
    # grant access to.
    kubernetes_cluster: example-k8s-cluster
    destination:
      type: directory
          # For this guide, /opt/machine-id is used as the destination directory.
          # You may wish to customize this. Multiple outputs cannot share the same
          # destination.
      path: /opt/machine-id
```

Ensure you replace `example-k8s-cluster` with the name of the Kubernetes cluster
as registered in Teleport.

If operating `tbot` as a background service, restart it. If running `tbot` in
one-shot mode, it must be executed before you attempt to use the credentials.

## Step 3/3. Connect to your Kubernetes cluster with the Machine ID identity

Once `tbot` has been run, credentials will be output to the directory specified
in the destination. Using the example of `/opt/machine-id`:

```code
## A `kubeconfig.yaml` should exist in the destination directory:
$ ls /opt/machine-id/kubeconfig.yaml
/opt/machine-id/kubeconfig.yaml

## Additionally, the log should mention the Kubernetes certificates:
$ journalctl -u machine-id | grep -i kubernetes
Jul 13 20:46:42 example tbot[29177]: INFO [TBOT]      Generated identity for Kubernetes cluster {"example-k8s-cluster"} tbot/renew.go:406
```

You can now use the generated `kubeconfig.yaml` to connect to the cluster with
`kubectl`:

```code
$ kubectl --kubeconfig /opt/machine-id/kubeconfig.yaml get pods -n demo
```

This `kubeconfig.yaml` can also be passed to any other Kubernetes API clients
that support credential provider plugins, including those built with
[`kubernetes/client-go`](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go) and most other
language libraries.
