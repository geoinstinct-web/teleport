description: How to use Machine ID with the Teleport Terraform provider to manage your Teleport configuration as IaC

In this guide, you will configure `tbot` to produce credentials for the Teleport
Terraform Provider and use Terraform to configure a Teleport role.

## Before you start

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)
- `tbot` must be configured and installed on your platform. Follow a
  [platform guide](../platform-guides.mdx) to do so.
- Terraform >= 1.0.0+

## Step 1/3. Configure RBAC

Use `tctl edit role/example-bot` to add the following rule to the role:

```yaml
spec:
  allow:
    rules:
    - resources:
      # Specify the names of resources you wish to manage with Terraform.
      # For this guide, we will only manage roles.
      - role
      verbs:
      - create
      - read
      - update
      - delete
      - list
```

## Step 2/3. Configure `tbot` output

Now, `tbot` needs to be configured with an output that will produce the
credentials needed by the Terraform provider. As the Terraform provider will be
accessing the Teleport API, the correct output type to use is `identity`.

For this guide, the `directory` destination will be used. This will write these
credentials to a specified directory on disk.

Modify your `tbot` configuration to add an `identity` output:

```yaml
outputs:
- type: identity
  destination:
    type: directory
    # For this guide, /opt/machine-id is used as the destination directory.
    # You may wish to customise this. Multiple outputs cannot share the same
    # destination.
    path: /opt/machine-id
```

If operating `tbot` as a background service, restart it. If running `tbot` in
one-shot mode, it must be executed before you attempt to execute the Terraform
plan later.

You should now see an `identity` file under `/opt/machine-id`. This contains
the private key and signed certificates needed by the Terraform provider to
authenticate with the Teleport Auth Server.

## Step 3/3. Use Terraform with the identity output

Start by creating a new Terraform working directory:

```code
$ mkdir ./my-terraform && cd ./my-terraform
$ terraform init
```

In order to configure the Teleport Terraform provider to use the credentials
output by Machine ID, we use the `identity_file_path` option. Whilst is is
possible to configure the Terraform provider using the TLS certificate, the
identity file provides support across more Teleport configurations.

This example creates a simple role for demonstrative purposes, this role is
unlikely to be useful within your Teleport Cluster. Therefore, once you have
confirmed that you have configured Terraform correctly, this resource should be
modified to suit your needs.

In this directory, create `main.tf`:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    teleport = {
      version = "(=teleport.version=)"
      source  = "terraform.releases.teleport.dev/gravitational/teleport"
    }
  }
}

provider "teleport" {
  # Replace with the address of your Teleport Proxy or Auth Server.
  addr               = "teleport.example.com:443"
  # Replace with the directory configured in the identity output in the
  # previous step.
  identity_file_path = "/opt/machine-id/identity"
}

# This is an example. Replace this with the resource you wish to be managed
# with Terraform. See the following reference for supported options:
# https://goteleport.com/docs/reference/terraform-provider/
resource "teleport_role" "terraform-test" {
  metadata = {
    name        = "terraform-test"
    description = "Example role created by Terraform"
  }

  spec = {
    allow = {
      logins = ["root"]
      node_labels = {
        key    = ["value"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace the address within the Teleport provider with that of your Teleport
Proxy or Auth Server and if you have modified the identity output directory,
adjust that here also.

Now, execute Terraform to test the configuration:

```code
$ terraform apply
```

Check your Teleport cluster, ensuring the role has been created.
