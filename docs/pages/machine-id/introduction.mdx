Teleport Machine ID enables machines, such as CI/CD workflows, to securely
authenticate with your Teleport cluster in order to connect to resources and
configure the cluster itself. This is sometimes referred to as Machine to
Machine (or M2M) access.

Machine ID supports a number of use-cases and platforms, but is commonly used
for:

- Granting CI/CD workflows access to resources such as SSH servers,
  Kubernetes Clusters, Databases and Applications that are protected by Teleport
  in order to deploy changes.
- Granting SecOps tooling access to resources in order to run security analysis
  against them.
- Creating and renewing credentials for custom scripts that leverage `tctl` or
  the Teleport API in order to control Teleport configuration.

Machine ID's design brings the existing benefits of the Teleport platform to
machine access, including:

- Short-lived, rotating certificate-based credentials.
- Rich auditing and session recording.
- Fine-grained role-based access control.
- Consistency with your techniques for managing human access.

## Concepts

For a more in-depth overview, check out the
[architecture page](./architecture.mdx). This covers the behind-the-scenes
elements of how Machine ID functions and provides a strong background knowledge
which can help in successfully deploying Machine ID.

### Bots

Machine ID provides machines with an identity that is compatible with the
Teleport cluster. This identity is known as a bot.

Bots share a number of similarities with human users:

- Access controlled by roles assigned to them in Teleport
- Access to resources recorded in audit logs
- Identity encoded in an x.509 client certificate which is signed by the
  Teleport Auth Service and which can then be used for access.

### Join tokens

The main difference is that a bot does not "log in" using a static username and
password. Instead, a join token is used. A join token is configured within
Teleport and specifies which bot user it grants access to and what sort of
proof (known as the join method) is needed to use this join token. This proof is
typically an identity issued to the machine by the platform it runs on (e.g. AWS
IAM). This process allows the machine to authenticate with the Teleport
cluster without using a long-lived secret.

### tbot

Machine ID is used through an agent called `tbot`. `tbot` authenticates with the
Teleport Cluster and then generates credentials and configuration files for
other tools to use to connect to Teleport resources using the bot's identity.

### Artifacts

The files generated by `tbot` are referred to as its artifacts. **Artifacts**
can be a number of things from credentials, such as signed certificates, to
configuration files that will automatically configure a tool (such as `kubectl`)
to use Teleport. This behaviour is controlled by configuring `tbot`'s
**outputs**. An output specifies what should be generated and where it should
be saved.
