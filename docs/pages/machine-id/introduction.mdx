Teleport Machine ID enables machines, such as CI/CD workflows, to securely
authenticate with your Teleport cluster in order to connect to resources and
configure the cluster itself.

Using Machine ID brings the existing benefits of the Teleport platform to
machine access:

- Short-lived, rotating credentials.
- Rich auditing and session recording.
- Fine-grained role-based access control.
- Consistency with your techniques for managing human access.

Machine ID supports a number of use-cases and platforms, but is commonly used
for:

- Granting CI/CD workflows access to resouces such as SSH servers,
  Kubernetes Clusters, Databases and Applications that are protected by Teleport
  in order to deploy changes.
- Granting SecOps tooling access to resources in order to run security analysis
  against them.
- Creating and renewing credentials for custom scripts that leverage `tctl` or
  the Teleport API in order to control Teleport configuration.

## Overview

Machine ID is used through an agent called `tbot`. `tbot` authenticates
with the Teleport cluster and then writes short-lived credentials and
configuration files (known as artifacts) to configured destinations (such as a
directory). These credentials can then be used by other tools to access a
Teleport cluster and its resources. In daemon mode, `tbot` continually renews
the short-lived credentials before they expire.

`tbot` authenticates with the Teleport cluster using a join token which grants
access to a Bot User. A Bot User is similar to a normal Teleport user but is
only accessible via a join token and cannot be "logged into" like a normal
user. A Bot User holds a single role, known as the Bot Role. This role gives
`tbot` the ability to generate certificates for specified Teleport roles.
