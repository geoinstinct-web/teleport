Teleport Machine ID enables machines, such as CI/CD workflows, to securely
authenticate with your Teleport cluster in order to connect to resources and
configure the cluster itself.

Using Machine ID brings the existing benefits of the Teleport platform to
machine access:

- Short-lived, rotating credentials.
- Rich auditing and session recording.
- Fine-grained role-based access control.
- Consistency with your techniques for managing human access.

Machine ID supports a number of use-cases and platforms, but is commonly used
for:

- Granting CI/CD workflows access to SSH servers, Kubernetes Clusters,
  Databases and Applications that are protected by Teleport in order to
  deploy changes.
- Granting SecOps tooling access to SSH servers and Kubernetes Clusters in order
  to run security analysis against them.
- Creating and renewing credentials for custom scripts that leverage `tctl` or
  the Teleport API in order to control Teleport configuration.

## Overview

Machine ID is implemented by the `tbot` agent. `tbot` manages authenticating
with your Teleport cluster and then generating and writing artifacts (such as
credentials and configuration files) to destinations. In daemon mode, it runs
continually, renewing these short-lived credentials before they expire.

The `tbot` agent authenticates to the cluster using a join token. The join token
grants access to a Bot User, which has a Bot Role.

This Bot Role grants the ability role impersonate roles.
