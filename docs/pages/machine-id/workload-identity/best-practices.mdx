This page covers common questions and best practices for using Teleport's
Workload Identity feature in production.

## Structuring SPIFFE IDs

The SPIFFE ID is a flexible identifier for workloads, and potentially even
users. It is ultimately up to your organization to decide how to structure
your SPIFFE ID namespace.

There's a few common strategies to structuring SPIFFE IDs. Generally, though, a
hierarchical structure is used, with the root of the hierarchy being the most
general and the deepest part being the most specific. This allows rules to be
created which allow access to a group of workloads that share common parts
of the hierarchy.

One strategy is to structure SPIFFE IDs based on the logical function of a
workload. For example, you may have a service named `processor` that falls
within a group of `payments` services. You could give this a SPIFFE ID of
`spiffe://example.teleport.sh/production/payments/processor`. You may then
decide that all `payments` services should be able to access each other and
create a rule that allows access to any SPIFFE ID that starts with
`spiffe://example.teleport.sh/production/payments`.

Another strategy is to structure the SPIFFE IDs using a more "physical" location
of a workload. This may still include elements that are "virtual". For example,
you may have a workload running on a VM on a host in a datacenter in London.
You could give this a SPIFFE ID of
`spiffe://example.teleport.sh/europe/uk/london/hypervisor-001/vm-a3847f`.
This is useful in a different way to the logical structure, it'd be ideal in a
case where you want to restrict a workload to only be able to access other
workloads which are physically proximate, such as a cache. You may say that
the cache located in London will only accept connections from workloads with a
SPIFFE ID that starts with `spiffe://example.teleport.sh/europe/uk`.

However, it's worth noting that a workload can possess multiple SVIDs and use
these for different purposes. This means you could actually use multiple
strategies. You'll want to ensure you use some form of namespacing to ensure
these two different types of SPIFFE ID don't collide. For example, taking our
last two examples we can prefix the ID with `phy` for the physical location
and `svc` for the logical location:

- spiffe://example.teleport.sh/phy/europe/uk/london/hypervisor-001/vm-a3847f
- spiffe://example.teleport.sh/svc/payments/processor

It's worth noting that the SPIFFE ID contained within a SVID is not secret and
is exposed to workloads that connect and that you connect out to. So avoid
placing sensitive information within the SPIFFE ID.
