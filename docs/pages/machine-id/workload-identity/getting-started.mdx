## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

## Step 1/3. Configure RBAC

First, Teleport must be configured to allow the credentials produced by `tbot`
to modify the Teleport configuration. It's important to grant as few
privileges as possible in order to limit the blast radius of an attack, so in
this example we grant only the ability to create and update roles.

If you have followed a platform guide, you will have created a role and granted
the bot the ability to impersonate it already. This role just needs to have the
additional privileges added to it.

Use `tctl edit role/example-bot` to add the following rule to the role:

```yaml
spec:
  allow:
    rules:
    - resources:
      # Specify the names of resources you wish to manage with tctl.
      # For this guide, we will only manage roles.
      - role
      verbs:
      - create
      - read
      - update
      - delete
      - list
```

### Step 2/3. Configure `spiffe-workload-api` service in `tbot`

### Step 3/3. Using the Workload API with an example service
