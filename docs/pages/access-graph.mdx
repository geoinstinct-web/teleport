<Admonition type="tip" title="Preview">
  Teleport Access Graph is currently in Preview. Currently, it is only available
  to the Teleport Cloud Team users. Currently, only SSH server are supported.
</Admonition>

Teleport Access Graph is a new way to visualize and understand access to your
infrastructure. It provides a visual representation of the relationships between
users, roles, and resources in your organization. It can help you answer
questions like:

- What resources can a specific user access?
- What users can access a specific resource?
- What are the relationships between users, roles, and resources?

After logging into the Teleport UI, go to the Management tab. If enabled, Access Graph options can be found
under the Permission Management section.

## Graph nodes

Teleport Access Graph divides your infrastructure into five main components:

1. Users

    ![User Node](../img/access-graph/user-node.png)

    Users are the people who access your infrastructure. They can be employees,
    contractors, or even bots.

2. User Groups

    ![User Group Node](../img/access-graph/user-group-node.png)

    User Groups are collections of users. They can be used to organize users
    based on their role or team.

3. Temporary user groups

    ![Temporary User Group Node](../img/access-graph/temporary-user-group-node.png)

    Temporary User Groups are created when a user is granted temporary access to a
    resource. They are automatically deleted when the user's access expires.

4. Actions

    ![Action Node](../img/access-graph/allow-action-node.png)

    Actions are the things that users can or cannot do. Actions are related to
    resources. For example, a user can SSH into a node.

5. Deny Actions

    ![Deny Action Node](../img/access-graph/deny-action-node.png)

    Deny Actions are the things that users cannot do. Deny Actions are related to
    resources. For example, a user cannot SSH into a node.

6. Temporary Actions

    ![Temporary Action Node](../img/access-graph/temporary-action-node.png)

    Temporary Actions are created when a user is granted temporary access to a
    resource. They are automatically deleted when the user's access expires.

7. Resource Groups

    ![Resource Group Node](../img/access-graph/resource-group-node.png)

    Resource Groups are collections of resources. They can be used to organize
    resources based on their role or team.

8. Resources

    ![Resource Node](../img/access-graph/resource-node.png)

    Resources are the things that users can or cannot access. They can be
    servers, databases, or Kubernetes clusters.

## How to use it

Teleport Access Graph can help you to answer questions like:

- Who can access a specific resource?

- What resources can a specific user access?

## How Teleport resources are represented

Teleport Access Graph imports all Teleport resources and keeps them up to date, so every time you make a change
to your Teleport resources, the Access Graph will reflect those changes.

#### Users

Users are created from Teleport Users.

#### User Groups

User Groups are created from Teleport Roles and access requests.

#### Actions

Actions are created from Teleport Roles. Actions can be divided into three
categories:

1. Allow Actions

    Allow Actions are created from Teleport Roles. Allow Actions are the things
    that users can do. For example, a user can SSH into a node.

2. Deny Actions

    Deny Actions are created from Teleport Roles. Deny Actions are the things
    that users cannot do. For example, a user cannot SSH into a node. Deny
    Actions take precedence over Allow Actions.

3. Temporary Actions

    Temporary Actions are created when a user is granted temporary access to a
    resource. They are automatically deleted when the user's access expires.

#### Resource Groups

Resource Groups are created from Teleport Roles.

#### Resources

Resources are created from Teleport resources like nodes, databases, and
Kubernetes clusters.
