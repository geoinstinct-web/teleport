<Admonition type="tip" title="Insecure Certificate Error">
  If you encounter an "Insecure Certificate Error" (or equivalent warning) that prevents the Teleport Web UI from opening, you can perform one of the following actions depending on your browser:

  - In Safari's "This Connection Is Not Private" page, click "Show Details," then click "visit this website."
  - In Firefox, click "Advanced" from the warning page, then click "Accept the Risk and Continue."
  - In Chrome's warning page, click "Advanced" then "Proceed to `URL`"
    - If a server previously acessible from this URL set an HSTS header, the "Proceed to" link will not display. Type `thisisunsafe` to ignore the HSTS header and proceed.
