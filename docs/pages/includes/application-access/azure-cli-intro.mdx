{{ credentialMethod }}. When a user authenticates to Teleport, they can
assume one of the respective user-assigned managed identities to execute
Azure CLI commands.

You can configure which Teleport users or roles have access to specific Azure
identities, giving you control over who can obtain credentials for different
levels of access to Azure CLIs.

The Teleport Application Service connects to the Teleport Proxy Service over a
reverse tunnel, so you can run the Application Service in a private network and
prevent unauthorized access to your organization's Azure identities.
