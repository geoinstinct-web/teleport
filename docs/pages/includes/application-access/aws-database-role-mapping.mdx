The next step is to give your Teleport users permissions to assume IAM roles in
your Teleport cluster.

You can do this by creating a Teleport role with the `aws_role_arns` field
listing the IAM role ARN created in the previous step. Create a file called
`{{ role }}.yaml` with the following content:

```code
$ cat > {{ role }}.yaml <<EOF
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: {{ role }}
spec:
  allow:
    app_labels:
      '*': '*'
    aws_role_arns:
    - arn:aws:iam::<Var name="aws-account-id"/>:role/{{ iam-role }}
EOF
```

<Details title="Templating aws_role_arns" opened={false}>
The `aws_role_arns` field supports template variables so they can be populated
dynamically based on your users' identity provider attributes. See [Role
Templates](docs/pages/access-controls/guides/role-templates.mdx) for details.

Create the new role:

```code
$ tctl create -f {{ role }}.yaml
```
