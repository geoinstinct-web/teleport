By default, `tbot` will run in daemon mode. However, a service must be created
on the host for `tbot` to run within in order for this to run in the background.
In this guide, configuration for systemd will be demonstrated but `tbot` should
be compatible with any service manager.

Create a systemd unit file `/etc/systemd/system/tbot.service`:

```code
[Unit]
Description=Teleport Machine ID Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=teleport
Group=teleport
Restart=on-failure
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/tbot start -c /etc/tbot.yaml
ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID
PIDFile=/run/tbot.pid
LimitNOFILE=524288

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Next, enable the service so that it will start on boot and then start the
service:

```code
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
$ sudo systemctl enable tbot
$ sudo systemctl start tbot
```

Check the service has started successfully:

```code
$ sudo systemctl status tbot
```
