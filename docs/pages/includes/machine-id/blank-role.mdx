Now, a role must be created that will be encoded into the credentials output by
`tbot`. This role will specify what the credentials will grant access to.
For now, this role will be "empty" - the access guides you complete after this
platform guide will instruct you to modify this role to grant the correct
privileges.

Create `bot-role.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: example-bot
spec:
  allow: {}
  deny: {}
  options: {}
```

Use `tctl` to apply this file:

```code
$ tctl create -f bot-role.yaml
```
