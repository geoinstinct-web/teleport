Now, you must configure `tbot` for either daemon or one-shot mode.

In daemon mode, `tbot` runs continually, renewing the short-lived credentials
for the configured outputs on a fixed interval. This is often combined with a
service supervisor (such as systemd) in order to run `tbot` in the background.
This is the default behaviour of `tbot`.

In one-shot mode, `tbot` generated its outputs and then exits. This is often

#### Configuring `tbot` as a daemon

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/daemon.mdx!)

#### Configuring `tbot` for one-shot mode

To use `tbot` in oneshot mode, modify `/etc/tbot.yaml` to add `oneshot: true`,
e.g:

```yaml
version: v2
oneshot: true
auth_server: ...
```

Now, you should test your `tbot` configuration. When started, several log
messages will be emitted before it exists with status 0. Start `tbot` to ensure
that it works correctly:

```code
$ tbot start -c /etc/tbot.yaml
```
