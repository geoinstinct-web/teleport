Now, you must configure `tbot` for either daemon or one-shot mode.

In daemon mode, `tbot` runs continually, renewing the short-lived credentials
for the configured outputs on a fixed interval. This is often combined with a
service supervisor (such as systemd) in order to run `tbot` in the background.
This is useful ... TODO

In one-shot mode, `tbot` generated its outputs and then exits. This is useful
in scenarios ... TODO

#### Configuring `tbot` as a daemon

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/daemon.mdx!)

#### Configuring `tbot` for one-shot mode

To use `tbot` in oneshot mode, modify `/etc/tbot.yaml` to add `oneshot: true`,
e.g:

```yaml
version: v2
oneshot: true
auth_server: ...
```

Start `tbot` to ensure that it works correctly:

```code
$ tbot start -c /etc/tbot.yaml
```

It should start, emit some log lines and then exit with status 0.
