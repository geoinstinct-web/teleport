Machine ID has two modes of deployment.

Daemon: `tbot` runs continually. Usually, this is combined with a service
supervisor such as systemd in order to continually provide and renew
short-lived credentials in the background. This is also necessary when using
the `token` join method which requires the bot to continually renew itself to
avoid its credentials expiring.

Oneshot: `tbot` runs once and then exits. This is ideal for situations where
credentials may only be needed for for a short period. The advantage of this is
that it is easy to determine whether `tbot` has run successfully before taking
an action that is dependent on the credentials `tbot` outputs. This mode is
generally not compatible with the `token` join method unless you can ensure that
`tbot` will be run often enough to prevent the bot's own identity expiring.
