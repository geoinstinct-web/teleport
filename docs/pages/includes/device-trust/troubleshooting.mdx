### "binary missing signature or entitlements" on `tsh device enroll`

A signed and notarized `tsh` binary is necessary to enroll and use a a trusted
device. [Download the macOS tsh installer](../../installation.mdx#macos) to fix
the problem.

### "unauthorized device" errors using a trusted device

A trusted device needs to be registered and enrolled before it is recognized by
Teleport as such. Follow the [registration](
../../access-controls/device-trust/device-management.mdx#register-a-trusted-device) and
[enrollment](
../../access-controls/device-trust/device-management.mdx#enroll-a-trusted-device) steps
and make sure to `tsh logout` and `tsh login` after enrollment is done.

### "Failed to open the TPM device" on Linux

Linux users need permissions to read and write from the TPM device, `/dev/tpmrm0`.
Without such permissions `tsh` would need `sudo` prompts for most operations.

The simplest way to solve this is to check if your distro ships with the `tss`
group and assign it to your OS user. If that is not possible, or you are looking
for a different solution, we recommend creating udev rules similar to the ones
shipped by the [TPM2 Software Stack](
https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tss/blob/ede63dd1ac1f0a46029d457304edcac2162bfab8/dist/tpm-udev.rules#L4).
