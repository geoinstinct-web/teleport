Teleport uses mutual TLS authentication with self-hosted databases. As such,
they must be configured with Teleport's certificate authority to be able to
verify client certificates and a certificate/key pair that Teleport can verify.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Self-hosted Teleport">
  With self-hosted version of Teleport use `tctl auth sign` command
  [locally](../../architecture/overview.mdx#tctl) on the Teleport Auth server
  to produce the secrets
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Teleport Cloud">
  With [Teleport Cloud](../../cloud/introduction.mdx) use `tctl auth sign`
  command on your client machine after logging in with `tsh login`.

  Your Teleport Cloud user must be allowed to impersonate the system role `Db`
  in order to be able to generate the database certificate, by having the
  following allow rule in their role:

  ```yaml
  allow:
    impersonate:
      users: ["Db"]
      roles: ["Db"]
  ```
