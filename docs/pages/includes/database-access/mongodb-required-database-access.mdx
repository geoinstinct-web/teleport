<Admonition type="note">
  MongoDB clients often need access to the `admin` database to establish
  successful connections and perform various operations, such as retrieving
  server information, listing databases, and aborting transactions. Ensure the
  `admin` database is included in the list of database names within your
  Teleport RBAC settings to ensure proper access and enable the clients to
  connect to the databases.
