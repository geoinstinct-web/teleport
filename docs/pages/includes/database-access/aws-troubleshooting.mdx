### Certificate error

If your `tsh db connect` error includes the following text, you likely have an RDS database created before July 28, 2020, which presents an X.509 certificate that is incompatible with Teleport:

```code
x509: certificate relies on legacy Common Name field, use SANs instead
```

AWS provides instructions to rotate your [SSL/TLS certificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html).

### No credential providers error

If you see the error `NoCredentialProviders: no valid providers in chain` in Database Service logs then Teleport
is not detecting the required credentials to connect via AWS IAM permissions. Check whether
the credentials or security role has been applied in the machine running the Teleport Database Service.

### Timeout errors

The Teleport Database Service needs connectivity to your database endpoints. That may require
enabling inbound traffic on the database from the Database Service on the same VPC or routing rules from another VPC. Using the `nc`
program you can verify connections to databases:

```code
nc -zv postgres-instance-1.sadas.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com 5432
# Connection to postgres-instance-1.sadas.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com (172.31.24.172) 5432 port [tcp/postgresql] succeeded!
```

### Not authorized to perform `sts:AssumeRole`

The Database Service assumes an IAM role that is used as `db_user` when
accessing AWS services that require IAM roles as database users, such as
DynamoDB, Keyspaces, and Redshift Serverless.

You may encounter the following error if the trust relationship is not
configured properly between the IAM roles:
```text
AccessDenied: User: arn:aws:sts::111111111111:assumed-role/database-service-role/i-* is not authorized to perform: sts:AssumeRole on resource: arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/database-user-role
```

To allow IAM Role `role1` to assume IAM Role `role2`, the following is
generally required:

<Details title="1. Configure Trust Relationships on role2">
`role1` or its AWS account should be set as `Principal` in `role2`'s trust
policy.

<TabsItem label="Role as principal">
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",

        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/role1"
      },

        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:root"

    }

  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/role1"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "sts:ExternalId": "example-external-id"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
</TabsItem>

</Tabs>
</Details>

<Details title="2. Configure Permissions Policies on role1">
`role1` requires `sts:AssumeRole` permissions, for example:
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/role2"
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that this policy can be omitted when `role1` and `role2` are in the same
AWS account and `role1`'s full ARN is configured as Principal in `role2`'s
trust policy.

</Details>

<Details title="3. Configure Permissions Boundary on role1">
`role1` also requires `sts:AssumeRole` permissions in its boundary policy, for
example:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that this is only required when a boundary policy is attached to `role1`.
</Details>

You can test the trust relationship by running this AWS CLI command as `role1`:
```code
aws sts assume-role --role-arn arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/role2 --role-session-name test-trust-relationship
```
