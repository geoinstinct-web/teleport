### Certificate Error

If your `tsh db connect` error includes the following text you likely have a RDS database created before July 28, 2020.

```code
x509: certificate relies on legacy Common Name field, use SANs instead
```

AWS provides instructions to rotate your [SSL/TLS certificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html). Even if
your database is using the `rda-ca-2019` certificate and was created before July 28, 2020 that 
will require rotation.

### No Credential Providers Error

If you see the error ` NoCredentialProviders: no valid providers in chain` in logs then Teleport
is not detecting the required Credentials to connect via AWS IAM permissions.  Check
the credentials or security role has been applied in the machine running the Teleport database service.

### Timeout Errors

The Teleport database service needs connectivity to the database endpoints.  That may require
enabling inbound traffic within the VPC or routing rules. Using the `nc`
program you can verify connections to databases.   

```code
nc -zv postgres-instance-1.sadas.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com 5432
# Connection to postgres-instance-1.sadas.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com (172.31.24.172) 5432 port [tcp/postgresql] succeeded!
```
