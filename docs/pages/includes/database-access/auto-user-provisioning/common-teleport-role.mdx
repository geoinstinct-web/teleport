To specify the database roles a user should be assigned within the database,
use the `db_roles` role option:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v7
metadata:
  name: auto-db-users
spec:
  options:
    # create_db_user_mode enables automatic user provisioning for matching databases
    create_db_user_mode: keep
  allow:
    db_labels:
      "*": "*"
    db_names:
    - "*"
    # db_roles is a list of roles the database user will be assigned
    db_roles:
    - reader
    - "{{internal.db_roles}}"
    - "{{external.db_roles}}"
```

With automatic user provisioning, users always connect to the database with
their Teleport username so the `db_users` role field is ignored for roles
that have database user provisioning enabled.

The available provisioning modes are:

* `off`: Disables user provisioning.

* `keep`: Enables user provisioning and disables users at session end. The user
  will be stripped of all roles and the user account will be locked.

* `best_effort_drop`: Enables user provisioning and tries to drop user
  at session end. If the drop fails, fallback to disabling them (same as `keep`
  mode).
