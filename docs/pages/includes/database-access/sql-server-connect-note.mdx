<Admonition type="note">
When you run the `tsh db connect` command above, `tsh` attempts to execute
the `mssql-cli` command-line client, which must be available in the user's
`PATH`. If you do not have `mssql-cli` available on your system, you can run the
following command to start a local proxy server that you can connect
to with your SQL Server client:

```code
$ tsh proxy db --db-user=teleport --tunnel sqlserver
```

Read the [Database Access GUI Clients](../../connect-your-client/gui-clients.mdx#sql-server-with-azure-data-studio) 
guide for how to connect your DB GUI client to the local proxy.
