Database discovery involves two components.

The first, the Discovery Service, is responsible for watching your cloud
provider and checking if there are any new databases or if there have been any
modifications to previously discovered databases.

The second, the Database Service, monitors the databases created by the
Discovery Service and proxies communications between users and the database
servers hosted by the cloud provider.

In this guide, you will configure a Teleport Discovery Service instance to
discover {{ cloud }}-hosted databases automatically.
