When you first start the app, Teleport Connect asks for permission to collect & send telemetry data.
This includes tracking events such as:
- Login
- Starting an SSH, database, or kube session
- File transfer during an SSH session
- Managing access requests
- Asking about job role

On login, we also collect some device-related data:

- Operating system and its version
- App version
- Processor architecture

The full list of events and collected data is defined as [protocol buffer messages in connect.proto](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/tree/branch/v(=teleport.major_version=)/proto/prehog/v1alpha/connect.proto).
We do not track the details of those events but merely that the given event took place. Each event includes
cluster name and user name anonymized with HMAC with internal cluster ID as the key – it’s impossible for us
to resolve that anonymized token back to a particular cluster or user.
