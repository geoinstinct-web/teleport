When you first start the app, Teleport Connect asks for permission to collect and send telemetry data.
This includes tracking events such as:
- Logging in to a cluster
- Starting an SSH, database, or Kubernetes session
- File transfer during an SSH session
- Creating an Access Request
- Reviewing an Access Request
- Assuming an Access Request

On login, we also collect some device-related data:

- Operating system and its version
- App version
- Processor architecture

Additionally, we ask for a job role (answer is optional).

The full list of events and collected data is defined as [protocol buffer messages in the Teleport source](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/tree/branch/v(=teleport.major_version=)/proto/prehog/v1alpha/connect.proto).
We do not track the details of those events but merely that the given event took place. Each event includes
the cluster name and user name anonymized with HMAC with the internal cluster ID as the key – it’s impossible for us
to resolve that anonymized token back to a particular cluster or user.
