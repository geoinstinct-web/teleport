Like all Teleport users, `access-plugin` needs signed credentials in
order to connect to your Teleport cluster. You will use the `tctl auth sign`
command to request these credentials for your plugin.

The following `tctl auth sign` command impersonates the `access-plugin` user,
generates signed credentials, and writes an identity file to the local
directory:

```code
$ tctl auth sign --user=access-plugin --out=auth.pem
```

Teleport's Access Request plugins listen for new and updated Access Requests by
connecting to the Teleport Auth Service's gRPC endpoint over TLS.

The identity file, `auth.pem`, includes both TLS and SSH credentials. Your
Access Request plugin uses the SSH credentials to connect to the Proxy Service,
which establishes a reverse tunnel connection to the Auth Service. The plugin
uses this reverse tunnel, along with your TLS credentials, to connect to the
Auth Service's gRPC endpoint.

You will refer to this file later when configuring the plugin.

  title="Certificate Lifetime"
>

  By default, `tctl auth sign` produces certificates with a relatively short
  lifetime. For production deployments, we suggest using [Machine
  ID](../../machine-id/introduction.mdx) to programmatically issue and renew
  certificates for your plugin. See our Machine ID [getting started
  guide](../../machine-id/getting-started.mdx) to learn more.

  Using impersonated credentials to issue the certificates requires you are
  logged with a session length higher then the desired certificate lifetime. For
  example if you want to issue 1000 hour length certificate you must be in a 1000+ hour
  session. The user's role must allow them to log in as that length time to live and the
  `ttl` parameter allows setting the session length with `tsh login`. For example:

  `tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --ttl=1001h`
