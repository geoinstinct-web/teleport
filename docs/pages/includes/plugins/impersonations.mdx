Teleport Cloud requires authenticating with a role that can create and impersonate
the `access-plugin` role and user. Log in with `tsh` with a user that has this role
or has a role with these `allow` rules.

```
kind: role
version: v4
metadata:
  name: plugin-admin
spec:
  allow:
    impersonate:
      roles:
      - access-plugin
      users:
      - access-plugin
    rules:
      - resources: ['roles']
        verbs: ['create','update','read','list','delete']
      - resources: ['user']
        verbs: ['create','update','read','list','delete']

```
