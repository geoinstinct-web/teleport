Teleport's Access Request plugins authenticate to your Teleport cluster as a
user with permissions to list and read Access Requests. This way, plugins can
retrieve Access Requests from the Teleport Auth Service and present them to
reviewers.

Define a user and role called `access-plugin` by adding the following content to
a file called `access-plugin.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: access-plugin
spec:
  allow:
    rules:
      - resources: ['access_request']
        verbs: ['list', 'read']
      - resources: ['access_plugin_data']
        verbs: ['update']
      # Optional: To display user-friendly names in resource-based access
      # requests instead of resource IDs, the plugin also needs permission
      # to list the resources being requested. Add applicable allow rules
      # and labels.
      - resources: ['node', 'app', 'db', 'kube_cluster']
        verbs: ['list', 'read']
    node_labels:
      '*': '*'
    kubernetes_labels:
      '*': '*'
    db_labels:
      '*': '*'
    app_labels:
      '*': '*'
    group_labels:
      '*': '*'
---
kind: user
metadata:
  name: access-plugin
spec:
  roles: ['access-plugin']
version: v2
```

Create the user and role:

```code
$ tctl create -f access-plugin.yaml
```
