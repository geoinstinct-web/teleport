Using an existing Teleport cluster, create the following `user` and `role` resources with the command below, replacing `YAML_PATH` with the path to each resource spec.

```
$ tctl create -f YAML_PATH.yaml
```

(!docs/pages/includes/plugins/impersonations.mdx!)

Create a non-interactive bot user and role called `access-plugin`.

```yaml
kind: user
metadata:
  name: access-plugin
spec:
  roles: ['access-plugin']
version: v2
---
kind: role
version: v4
metadata:
  name: access-plugin
spec:
  allow:
    rules:
      - resources: ['access_request']
        verbs: ['list', 'read', 'update']
      - resources: ['access_plugin_data']
        verbs: ['update']
```

<Admonition type="tip">
  If you're using other plugins, you might want to create different users and roles for different plugins
