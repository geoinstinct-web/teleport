<Admonition type="tip" title="Tip">
  The examples below may include the use of the `sudo` keyword, token UUIDs, and users with `admin` privileges to make following each step easier when creating resources from scratch. 
  
  Generally:

  1. We discourage using `sudo` in production environments unless it's needed.
  2. You can run Teleport's auth, proxy, application access, Kubernetes access, and database access services as a non-root user - only the SSH/node service requires root access. You will, however, also need root permissions (or the `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` capability) to make Teleport listen on a port numbered < 1024 (e.g. 443)
  3. We encourage creating new, non-root, users or new test instances for experimenting with Teleport.
  4. We encourage adherence to the *Principle of Least Privilege* (PoLP) and *Zero Admin* best practices. Don't give users the `admin` role when giving them the more restrictive `access,editor` roles will do instead.
  5. Saving tokens into a file rather than sharing tokens directly *as strings*.
