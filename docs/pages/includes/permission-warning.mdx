<Admonition type="tip" title="Tip">
  The examples below may include the use of the `sudo` keyword, token UUIDs, and users with `admin` privileges to make following each step easier when creating resources from scratch. 
  
  Generally:
  
  1. We discourage using `sudo` in production environments unless it's needed. 
  2. We encourage creating new, non-root, users or new test instances for experimenting with Teleport.
  3. We encourage adherence to the *Principle of Least Privilege* (PoLP) and *Zero Admin* best practices. Don't give users the `admin` role when giving them the more restrictive `access,editor` roles will do instead.
  4. Saving tokens into a file rather than sharing tokens directly *as strings*.
