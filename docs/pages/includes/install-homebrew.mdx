 <Notice type="danger">

The Teleport package in Homebrew is not maintained by Teleport and we can't
guarantee its reliability or security. We recommend the use of our [official
Teleport packages](https://goteleport.com/teleport/download?os=mac).

<ScopedBlock scope={["enterprise", "cloud"]}>

The Homebrew version of Teleport lacks the ability to maintain SAML/OIDC authentication
connectors through the `tctl` binary. We recommend installing the official Teleport Enterprise edition of `tctl`.

</ScopedBlock>

</Notice>

To install Teleport with Homebrew, run the following command:

```code
$ brew install teleport
```

If you choose to use Homebrew, you must verify that the versions of `tsh`
and `tctl` you run on your local machine are compatible with the versions
you run on your infrastructure. Homebrew usually ships the latest release of
Teleport, which may be incompatible with older versions. See our
[compatibility policy](../management/operations/upgrading.mdx) for details.

To verify versions, log in to your cluster and compare the output of `tctl status`
against `tsh version` and `tctl version`.
