### Using the Web UI

If you get "access denied" or other login errors, the number one place to check is the Audit
Log. You can access it in the **Activity** tab of the Teleport Web UI.

Example of a user being denied because the role `clusteradmin` wasn't set up:

```json
{
  "code": "T1001W",
  "error": "role clusteradmin is not found",
  "event": "user.login",
  "method": "oidc",
  "success": false,
  "time": "2019-06-15T19:38:07Z",
  "uid": "cd9e45d0-b68c-43c3-87cf-73c4e0ec37e9"
}
```
### Teleport does not show the expected Nodes
When Teleport's Auth Service receives a request to list Teleport Nodes,
it only returns the Nodes that a user is authorized to access. 

A user's Teleport roles must grant the user explicit access to Nodes with a particular label
 before the user can view those Nodes. The Auth Service compares the user's 
`traits.logins` with the `allow` and `deny` rules defined in each of the user's roles. 

If the user's logins match a role's `allow` and `deny` rules, and a Node's labels match 
the keys and values listed within a role's `node_labels` field, then the Auth Service will
list the Node in response to the user's request.

When configuring SSO, ensure that the identity provider is populating each user's 
traits correctly. For a user to see a Node in Teleport, the result of populating a
template variable in a role's `allow.logins` must match at least one of a user's
`traits.logins`.

 In this example a user will have usernames `ubuntu`, `debian` and usernames from the SSO trait `logins` for Nodes that have a `env: dev` label.  If the SSO trait username is `bob` then the usernames would include `ubuntu`, `debian`, and `bob`.
```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: example-role
spec:
  allow:
    logins: ['{{external.logins}}', ubuntu, debian]
    node_labels:
      'env': 'dev'
version: v5
```
