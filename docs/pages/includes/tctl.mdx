Verify that your Teleport client is connected:

```bash
tctl status

# Cluster  tele.example.com
# Version  (=teleport.version=)
# CA pin   sha256:sha-hash-here
```

<Admonition type="note" title="Connecting to the cloud">
To try this flow in the cloud, login into your cluster using tsh, then use tctl remotely:

```bash
tsh login --proxy=myinstance.teleport.sh:443

# tctl (Enterprise edition) can use tsh credentials as of version 5.0
tctl status
```
