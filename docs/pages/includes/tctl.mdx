title="Make sure you can connect to Teleport" 
>

To connect to Teleport, log in to your cluster using `tsh`, then use `tctl`
remotely:

```code
$ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=email@example.com
$ tctl status
# Cluster  teleport.example.com
# Version  (=teleport.version=)
# CA pin   (=presets.ca_pin=)
```

You can run subsequent `tctl` commands in this guide on your local machine.

For full privileges, self-hosted Teleport users can also run `tctl` commands on
your Auth Service host.
