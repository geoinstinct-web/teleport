### Kubernetes authentication
To authenticate to a Kubernetes cluster via Teleport, your Teleport roles must
allow access as at least one Kubernetes user or group. Ensure that you have a
Teleport role that grants access to the cluster you plan to interact with.

1. Run the following command to get the Kubernetes user for your current context:

```code
$ kubectl config view \
-o jsonpath="{.contexts[?(@.name==\"$(kubectl config current-context)\")].context.user}"
```

2. Create a file called `kube-access.yaml` with the following content, replacing
`USER` with the output of the command above.

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: kube-access
version: v5
spec:
  allow:
    kubernetes_labels:
      '*': '*'
    kubernetes_groups:
    - viewers
    kubernetes_users:
    - USER
  deny: {}
```

3. Retrieve your Teleport user:

```code
$ TELEPORT_USER=myuser
$ tctl get user/${TELEPORT_USER?} > user.yaml
```

4. Add `kube-access` to your Teleport user's list of roles:

```diff
   roles:
+  - kube-access
```

5. Apply your changes:

```code
$ tctl create -f kube-access.yaml
$ tctl create -f user.yaml
```

Now that Teleport RBAC is configured, you can authenticate to your Kubernetes cluster via Teleport.
alone does not allow you to actually do anything in the Kubernetes cluster; for that you need **authorization**.

### Kubernetes authorization

To configure **authorization** within your Kubernetes cluster, you need to create Kubernetes RoleBindings or
`ClusterRoleBindings` that grant permissions to the subjects listed in `kubernetes_users` and
`kubernetes_groups`.

For example, you can grant some limited read-only permissions to the `viewers` group used in the `kube-access`
role defined above:

1. Create a file called `viewers-bind.yaml` with the following contents:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: viewers-crb
subjects:
- kind: Group
  # Bind the group "viewers", corresponding to the kubernetes_groups we assigned our "kube-access" role above
  name: viewers
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  # "view" is a default ClusterRole which grants read-only access to resources
  # See: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#user-facing-roles
  name: view
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

2. Apply the ClusterRoleBinding with kubectl:

```code
$ kubectl apply -f viewers-bind.yaml
```

3. Log out of Teleport and log in again.
