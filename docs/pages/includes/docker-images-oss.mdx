We provide a pre-built multi-arch Docker image for every version of Teleport,
including images for `amd64`, `arm`, and `arm64` architectures. Our images contain only Teleport binaries
and their application dependencies.

These images are hosted on Amazon ECR Public. All tags under `public.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-distroless` [are Teleport Open Source images](https://gallery.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-distroless).

The table below gives an idea of how our image naming scheme works. We offer
images that point to a static version of Teleport as well as images that are
automatically rebuilt every night. These nightly images point to the latest
version of Teleport from the three most recent release branches. They are
stable, and we recommend their use to keep your Teleport installation up to
date.

|Image name|Teleport version|Image automatically updated?|Troubleshooting Tools?|Image base|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|`public.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-distroless:(=teleport.major_version=)`|The latest version of Teleport Open Source|Yes|No|[Distroless Debian 11](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless)|
|`public.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-distroless-debug:(=teleport.major_version=)`|The latest version of Teleport Open Source|Yes|Yes|[Distroless Debian 11](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless)|
|`(=teleport.latest_oss_docker_image=)`|The version specified in the image's tag (i.e. (=teleport.version=))|No|No|[Distroless Debian 11](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless)|
|`(=teleport.latest_oss_debug_docker_image=)`|The version specified in the image's tag (i.e. (=teleport.version=))|No|Yes|[Distroless Debian 11](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless)|

For testing, we always recommend that you use the latest released version of Teleport, which is currently `(=teleport.latest_oss_docker_image=)`.

The `*-debug` images include a Busybox shell and tool suite in addition to Teleport, and are intended for troubleshooting deployments only. They are not intended for production use.

[Ubuntu 20.04](https://hub.docker.com/\_/ubuntu)-based images are available from our 
[Legacy Amazon ECR Public repository](https://gallery.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-ent).
Their use is considered deprecated, and they may be removed in future releases.
