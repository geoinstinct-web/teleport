# Getting Started

Let's connect to Grafana using Teleport Application Access.

To achieve this we will:

1. Launch Grafana in a Docker container.
2. Install Teleport and configure it it to proxy Grafana.
3. Access Grafana through Teleport.

## Prerequisites

* Docker to launch Grafana in a container. Alternatively, if you have another
  web application you'd like to protect with App Access, you can use that instead.
* Configured DNS records for the host where Teleport service will be running
  are required to automatically fetch a Let's Encrypt certificate. For this
  guide we will assume your Teleport cluster will be accessible at `teleport.example.com`
  and `*.teleport.example.com`.

## Step 1/3. Start Grafana

We've picked Grafana for this tutorial since it's very easy to run with zero
configuration required. If you have another web application you'd like to
expose, skip over to Step 2.

Grafana can be launched in a [Docker container](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/docker/)
with a single command:

```sh
$ docker run -d -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana
```

Make sure to launch it on the same node where your Teleport service will be
running, for the simplicity of the tutorial.

## Step 2/3. Install and Configure Teleport

Download the latest version of Teleport for your platform from our
[downloads page](https://goteleport.com/teleport/download).

Teleport requires a valid TLS certificate to operate and can fetch one automatically
using Let's Encrypt [ACME](https://letsencrypt.org/how-it-works/) protocol.

As mentioned in prerequisites above, we will assume that you have configured DNS
records for `teleport.example.com` and `*.teleport.example.com` to point to the
node where you're launching Teleport.

Let's generate a Teleport config with ACME enabled:

```shell
$ teleport configure --cluster-name=teleport.example.com --acme --acme-email=alice@example.com > /tmp/teleport.yaml
```

<Admonition
  type="warning"
  title="Web Proxy Port"
>
  Teleport's ACME protocol integration currently requires web proxy to run on
  port 443.
</Admonition>

Now start Teleport and point it to the application endpoint:

```shell
$ sudo teleport start --config=/tmp/teleport.yaml \
  --roles=proxy,auth,app \
  --app-name=grafana \
  --app-uri=http://localhost:3000
```

Make sure to update `--app-name` and `--app-uri` accordingly if you're using
your own web application.

Next let's create a user that access to the application we've just connected.
Teleport has a built-in role called `access` that allows users to access cluster
resources. Create a local user assigned this role:

```sh
$ tctl users add --roles=access alice
```

The command will output a signup link. Use it to choose a password and set up
second factor. After that it will take you to the Teleport web UI.

## Step 3/3. Access the Application

There are a couple of ways to access the proxied application.

Every application is assigned a public address which you use to navigate to
the application directly. In our sample Grafana application we have provided a public address with
the `--app-public-addr` flag, so go to https://grafana.teleport.example.com
(replace with your app public address) to access the app. If you're not logged into Teleport,
you will need to authenticate before the application will show.

Alternatively, log into the Teleport web UI at https://teleport.example.com
(replace with your proxy public address). All available applications are
displayed on the Applications tab. Click on the Grafana application tile
to access it.
