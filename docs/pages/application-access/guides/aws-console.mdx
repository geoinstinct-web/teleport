# AWS Management Console Access

Teleport can automatically sign your users into AWS management console with
appropriate IAM roles.

This guide will explain how to:

- Connect your AWS account(-s) to Teleport.
- Use Teleport's role-based access control with AWS IAM roles.
- View Teleport users' AWS console activity in CloudTrail.

## Prerequisites

- Teleport with Application Access. Follow [Getting Started](../getting-started.mdx)
  or [Connecting Apps](./connecting-apps.mdx) guides to get it running.
- IAM permissions in the AWS account you want to connect.

## Step 1. Update IAM roles trust relationships

Teleport uses AWS [Federation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_enable-console-custom-url.html)
service to generate sign-in URLs for users, which relies on the `AssumeRole` API
for getting temporary security credentials. As such, you would first need to
update your IAM roles' "Trusted entities" to include AWS account ID.

Go to the [Roles](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/roles) list, pick
a role and create the following trust policy for it by clicking on "Edit trust
relationship" button on the "Trust relationships" tab:

```yaml
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:root"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

See [How to use trust policies with IAM roles](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-use-trust-policies-with-iam-roles/)
for more details. After saving the trust policy, the account will show as a
trusted entity:

![AWS trusted entities](../../../img/application-access/aws-trusted-entities@2x.png)

Do this for each IAM role your Teleport users will need to assume.

## Step 2. Give Teleport permissions to assume roles

Next, create the following IAM policy to allow Teleport to assume IAM roles:

```yaml
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

<Admonition type="note">
You can make the policy more strict by providing specific IAM role resource
ARNs in the Resource field instead of using a wildcard.
</Admonition>

Attach this policy to the IAM role/user your Teleport application service agent
is using.

## Step 3. Configure Teleport IAM role mapping

The next step is to give your Teleport users permissions to assume IAM roles.

You can do this by creating a role with `aws_role_arns` field listing all IAM
role ARNs this particular role permits its users to assume:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v4
metadata:
  name: aws-console-access
spec:
  allow:
    app_labels:
      '*': '*'
    aws_role_arns:
    - arn:aws:iam::1234567890:role/ec2-read-only
    - arn:aws:iam::1234567890:role/ec2-full-access
    - arn:aws:iam::0987654321:role/example-role
```

The `aws_role_arns` field supports template variables so they can be populated
dynamically based on your users' identity provider attributes. See [Role Templates](../../access-controls/guides/role-templates.mdx)
for details.

## Step 4. Register AWS console application in Teleport

Add AWS management console to your application service configuration:

```yaml
app_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  apps:
  - name: "awsconsole"
    uri: "https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home"
```

Note that URI must start with `https://console.aws.amazon.com` in order to be
recognized as an AWS console.

### Multiple AWS accounts

If you have multiple AWS accounts and would like to logically separate them
in the UI, register an application entry for each and set `aws_account_id`
label to the account ID:

```yaml
app_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  apps:
  - name: "awsconsole-test"
    uri: "https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home"
    labels:
      aws_account_id: "1234567890"
      env: test
  - name: "awsconsole-prod"
    uri: "https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home"
    labels:
      aws_account_id: "0987654321"
      env: prod
```

When showing available IAM roles, Teleport will display only role ARNs that
belong to the specific account.

## Step 5. Connect to AWS console with assumed IAM role

Navigate to the Applications tab in your Teleport cluster's control panel and
click on the Launch button for the AWS console application which will bring up
an IAM role selector:

![IAM role selector](../../../img/application-access/iam-role-selector.png)

Click on the role you want to assume and you will get redirected to AWS
management console signed in with the selected role.

In the console's top-right corner you should see that you're logged in through
federated login and the name of your assumed IAM role:

![Federated login](../../../img/application-access/federated-login@2x.png)

Note that your federated login session is marked with your Teleport username.

## Step 6. Use CloudTrail to see Teleport user activity

To view CloudTrail events for your federated sessions, navigate to the CloudTrail
[dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/home) and go to "Event history".

Each Teleport federated login session uses Teleport username as the federated
username which you can search for to get the events history:
