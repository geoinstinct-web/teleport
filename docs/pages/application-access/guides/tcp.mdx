# TCP Apps Access (Preview)

Teleport can provide access to any TCP-based application. This allows users to
connect to applications which Teleport doesn't natively support such as SMTP
servers or databases not yet natively supported in Database Access.

## Prerequisites

You will need a running Teleport cluster, either self-hosted or in Teleport Cloud.
We'll assume that you followed the [Getting Started](../getting-started.mdx)
guide or the general [App Access Usage](./connecting-apps.mdx) guide to install
Teleport and setup an Application Service.

## Step 1/3. Configure TCP app

Include your TCP application in the `teleport.yaml` configuration of Teleport
Application Service:

```yaml
app_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  apps:
  - name: "tcp-app"
    uri: tcp://localhost:9876
    labels:
      app: tcp-app
```

Note that the URI scheme must be `tcp://` in order for Teleport to recognize
this as a TCP application.

You can also register the application [dynamically](./dynamic-registration.mdx)
using `tctl create`.

## Step 2/3. Start app proxy

Log into your Teleport cluster and view available applications:

```code
$ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com
$ tsh app ls
Application Description   Type Public Address                   Labels
----------- ------------- ---- -------------------------------- -----------
tcp-app                   TCP  tcp-app.root.gravitational.io    app=tcp-app
```

Your TCP application should show up and be denoted with a `TCP` type.

Now log into the application:

```code
$ tsh app login tcp-app
Logged into TCP app tcp-app. Start the local TCP proxy for it:

  tsh proxy app tcp-app

Then connect to the application through this proxy.
```

Before you can connect to the application, you need to start a local proxy for
it:

```code
$ tsh proxy app tcp-app
Proxying connections to tcp-app on 127.0.0.1:55868
```

## Step 3/3. Connect

Once the local proxy is running, you can connect to the application through
the tunnel using the application client you would normally use to connect to
it.

For example, if this was a PostgreSQL server, you could use `psql` to connect:

```code
$ psql postgres://postgres@localhost:55868/postgres
```
