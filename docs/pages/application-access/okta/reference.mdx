## Configuration

(!docs/pages/includes/backup-warning.mdx!)

The following snippet shows the full YAML configuration of an Okta Service
appearing in the `teleport.yaml` configuration file:

```yaml
(!docs/pages/includes/config-reference/okta-service.yaml!)
```

## Okta import rule resources

Full YAML spec of Okta import rule resources managed by `tctl` resource commands:

```yaml
kind: okta_import_rule
version: v1
metadata:
  # Okta import rule name.
  name: test-rule
  # Okta import rule description.
  description: "Okta import rule for admins"
spec:
  # Mappings describes a list of match directives that describe what lavels to
  # apply to specific Okta groups and applications that will be synchronized
  # into Teleport.
  mappings:
  - match:
    # Individual application IDs can be used to create matches. Imported Okta
    # applications will be matched based on the app IDs listed here.
    - app_ids: ["app1", "app2"]
    # These lablels will be added to matching applications.
    add_labels:
      app_label: app_label_value
  - match:
    # Similarly, group IDs can be used to create matches.
    - group_ids: ["group1", "group2"]
    # These labels will be added to the groups.
    add_labels:
      label1: value1
```

You can create a new `okta_import_rule` resource by running the following commands, which
assume that you have created a YAML file called `okta-import-rule.yaml` with your configuration:

<ScopedBlock scope={["enterprise"]}>

```code
# Log in to your cluster with tsh so you can use tctl from your local machine.
# You can also run tctl on your Auth Service host without running "tsh login"
# first.
$ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=myuser
# Create the resource
$ tctl create -f okta-import-rule.yaml
```

</ScopedBlock>

## Okta assignment resources

Full YAML spec of Okta assignment resources queried by `tctl` resource commands:

```yaml
kind: okta_assignment
version: v1
metadata:
  # The name of the Okta assignment.
  name: test-assignment
spec:
  # The user that the Okta assignment is granting access for.
  user: test-user@test.user
  # The list of targets to grant access to.
  targets:
  # An application target.
  - type: 1
    id: "123456"
  # A group target.
  - type: 2
    id: "234567"
  # The current status of the Okta assignment.
  status: 1
```

These objects are internally facing and are not intended to be modified by users. However,
you can query them for informational or debugging purposes.

## CLI

This section shows CLI commands relevant for application access.

### tsh get okta_import_rules

Lists available Okta import rules.

```code
$ tsh get okta_import_rules
```

### tsh get okta_import_rules/NAME

Gets an individual Okta import rule.

```code
$ tsh get okta_import_rules/my-import-rule
```

### tsh rm okta_import_rules/NAME

Removes an individual Okta import rule.

```code
$ tsh rm okta_import_rules/my-import-rule
```

### tsh get okta_assignments

Lists available Okta assignments.

```code
$ tsh get okta_assignments
```

### tsh get okta_assignments/NAME

Gets an individual Okta assignment.

```code
$ tsh get okta_assignments/my-assignment
```

## Troubleshooting

### No Okta groups or applications seen in the Teleport UI

If the Teleport applications UI isn't displaying any Okta applications, ensure
that the Okta API token and endpoint are correct in the Okta service.

If they are, double check the user permissions and ensure that the user has
appropriate resource and label level access to the groups and applications. You
may need to tweak the `app_labels` and `group_labels` sections of a role in order
to see these resources.
