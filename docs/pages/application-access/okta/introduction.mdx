title: Okta integration with Application Access
description: How to set up Okta integration with Teleport Application Access.
---

Teleport allows applications housed within Okta to be integrated with the
Application Access service. This will result in Okta applications showing up
in Teleport's applications list in the UI and CLI, and it will further allow
for the user of Teleport's role based access control to control access within
Okta.

Users will be able request and be granted access to applications and groups
within Okta by requesting access to them within Teleport.

## How does the Okta integration work?

Teleport provides an Okta service that is responsible for dealing with all
interactions with Okta. There are three main components of the Okta service:

* Synchronization
* User access
* Access requests

### Synchronization

Teleport's Okta integration uses an Okta API token and endpoint in order to interact
with Okta's API. Teleport will then synchronize Okta's applcations and user groups
with Teleport. Labels for these groups and applications can be customized through the
use of Okta Import Rule objects within Teleport.

### User access

Upon logging into Teleport, users will be granted access to the Okta applications
and user groups that they have access to within Teleport. If a user has RBAC access to
an application or user group, it will be reflected within Okta.

### Access requests

Users can use Teleport's native access request functionality in order to
request temporary access to Okta applications and user groups. Upon expiration of the
access request, the access granted will be revoked within Okta.
