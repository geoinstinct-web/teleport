Technical documentation can be a challenging business, and this challenge can mean 
wrangling a many-headed, many-handed beast. To help us stay on course—provide our 
North Star—this guide describes our approach to building effective documentation, 
the conventions we follow, and the recommended practices for organizing, crafting, 
and evolving our information architecture with a clear and consistent voice.

First things first: technical documentation is separate from marketing communications. 
Marketing communications, brand awareness, positioning, and other types of content are 
important and provide the underpinnings of what we do. However, our focus is on providing 
the technical content that helps people to get work done. We strive to provide the conceptual 
and practical information that the community needs to be successful using Teleport  
and related technologies.

This guide focuses on best practices for writing technical documentation and on the style 
conventions to use when developing documentation for Teleport products and Teleport audiences. 
The goal of this guide is to help members of the documentation team and any one interested 
in contributing to documentation write material that is clear, concise, and consistent.

## Information types and pages

Depending on your point of view and goals, information can be classified in different ways.
The classic broad categories classify information as:

- Factual information
- Conceptual information
- Procedural information
- Reference information

### Organizing information into purpose-driven documents

These information categories often translate into separate documents—or
sections within documents—that serve a specific purpose or audience. 
For software documentation, you can typically structure information using the
following basic information model:

- Tutorials are learning-oriented and designed to give a newcomer a positive, successful 
  experience. Tutorials should be tested regularly to ensure they don't get stale and that
  they always provide a successful result.
- How-to guides are task-oriented with practical steps to achieve a specific goal. 
  These guides assume that readers are familiar enough with Teleport that they know the task
  they want to complete for a specific scenario but not necessarily how to complete it.
- References are information-oriented technical descriptions of a system or its components.
- Explanations are the conceptual framework for understanding how or why a system works.
  Explanation provide the context that surrounds what people learn in a tutorial, do in a 
  how-to guide, or look up in reference material.

For more detailed information and examples of how to structure documentation using this 
information model, see [The Grand Unified Theory of Documentation](https://documentation.divio.com/).

### Structuring content into pages

In general, every page of documentation should have a purpose and be self-contained. 
It's okay for information to be in multiple places and similar content can exist in 
pages that serve different purposes. For example, you might have conceptual information
about trusted clusters in one page and have similar content as context in a how-to topic.
When possible, you should reuse content rather than duplicate content, but it's perfectly
fine to cover the same information in more than one place to serve different purposes.

## General guidance for engaging content

There are three keys to writing content that engages the audience:

- Use the *second person* point of view to directly address the reader.
- Use an *active voice* and *present tense* whenever possible.
- Use a *conversational tone* that is not too formal or too chummy.

### Point of view

In most cases, address the reader directly. For tutorials, use either first person 
plural—we, us, our, ours—or second person point of view. Because tutorials provide a 
more guided approach to a topic, using the first person plural is a more natural and 
commonly-accepted practice than in other types of documentation.

Use the first person point of view sparingly and with intention. When overused, the 
first person narrative can overwhelm the sense of a shared experience and obscure the 
reader's journey.

Don't use “I” or “me” unless it appears in the text of a user interface element.

Avoid using “we” unless you have a really good rationale for it. For example, if you 
are documenting a recommended setting or practice, using “We recommend...” is ambiguous
("we" being who exactly?) and potentially dangerous if something goes wrong. If there
are industry best practices or recommendations, it's okay to indicate that instead of 
using the royal or editorial "we" in documentation.

### Passive constructions

In spite of the axiom to never use the passive voice, there are situations where a 
passive sentence structure might be appropriate. Don't twist a sentence into knots just 
to avoid a passive construction. Passive voice does have its place, but be wary of using it.

When writing about software, it's often tempting to describe what's happening from the 
code point of view. However, there's almost always a human being with a goal or task to 
complete who is initiating the activity that the software is executing. If you keep this 
human presence in mind, your writing will be more dynamic, easier to follow, and more 
interesting to read.

### Contractions and conversational tone

Contractions are generally acceptable because they give documentation a more natural 
conversational tone—at least for English speakers. Be conscious of when and why you use 
contractions.

To keep the tone conversational but concise, adhere to the following common-sense guidelines:

- Use common, well-known words whenever possible.
- Don't use flowery language or literary flourish words and phrases like “and so forth”, 
  “albeit”, “heretofore”, or “thus”.
- Try to be precise in word choice. For example:

    - Don't use “when”—implying eventuality and time—as interchangeable with “if”, which implies 
      the possibility of something happening.
    - Don't use phrases that introduce ambiguity. For example, instead of “When the process 
      completes…” use “After the process completes…”.
    - Think carefully about word choices like using “since” (implying a period of time) instead 
      of “because” (implying cause and result) or using “once” (single occurrence) instead of 
      “after” (each time).

- Avoid using dead language words and phrases even if they are generally accepted as English 
  words in practice. For example:

    - Instead of “i.e.”, use “that is” or rewrite the sentence to make the meaning clear without 
      needing extra qualification.
    - Instead of “e.g.”, use “for example”.
    - Instead of “via”, use an appropriate English substitute such as “by”, “through”, 
      "from", or “using”.
    - Instead of “etc.”, use “and so on” or revise the content to make the term unnecessary. 
      For example, revise to use *such as* or *like* followed by an example or two.
    - Instead of “caveat”, use an appropriate English substitute such as “notice”, 
      “caution”, or “warning”.

- Avoid adding unnecessary words or phrases. For example:

    - Instead of “In order to”, just use “to”.
    - Instead of “as well as”, just use “and”.
    - Instead of “and then”, just use “then”.
    - Avoid jargon, colloquialisms, and idiomatic phrases.

- Avoid adverbs and subjective statements. For example, don't use words and phrases like 
  easily, rapidly, simply, quickly.

    - Experienced developers who ~~truly~~ prefer to skip the tutorial...
    - We can ~~quickly~~ test this code is functioning as expected...

### Headings

All heading levels should use the following conventions:

- Use sentence case. Sentence case means that only the initial word and proper nouns are 
  capitalized.
- Use active, present tense verbs in headings wherever appropriate, especially in the 
  context of tutorials and how-to guides.
- Use noun phrases for conceptual and reference topics whenever possible.
- Summarize as succinctly as possible the content they contain.
- Avoid generic headings like overview and introduction, if possible. While generic 
  headings can be conceptually useful, they add no value to the content or the navigational 
  experience.
- Always contain content. A heading should never be immediately followed by another 
  heading. As a best practice, avoid using headings strictly for navigation.

### Limit heading levels

As a best practice, avoid building an information hierarchy with more than three heading 
levels. Most content can be effectively organized using two internal heading levels, making 
it easier to navigate and scan for relevant topics. 

### Topic titles

Avoid using gerunds (verbs ending in -ing) in titles and headings. Procedure titles and 
headings should answer the question: *What are you trying to do?* For example, if the answer 
to *What are you trying to do?* is *I want to create an account*, the article heading 
should be *Create an account*. In most cases, concept and reference topics that aren't 
related to tasks are named with a noun phrase, such as *Trusted clusters*. 

### Lists

Introduce lists with a heading, a sentence, or a fragment that ends with a colon. 

- Use **bulleted lists** for items that don't need to appear in order. Make all list 
  items parallel in structure. For example, start each item in the list using a noun 
  or a phrase that starts with a verb.
- Use **numbered lists** only for processes and procedures that must be completed in 
  sequential order.

### Bullets

Bullets are for unordered lists. The order of items in a bulleted list can imply 
importance, but generally all list items are peers. Each list item should start with 
a capital letter and end with a period unless all of the list items are single words 
or short phrases of no more than four words. Use parallel structure in phrasing the 
items in a list. For example, each list item might start with a verb, noun, or gerund. 

### Numbered steps

Only use numbered paragraphs for steps in procedures. If a procedure has more than nine steps, 
always consider breaking it into subsections with headings. Ideally, each procedure or subtask 
should be three to six steps, not have nested sub-steps, and have minimal embedded paragraphs 
describing what happens—the result or outcome to expect—in an unnumbered paragraph following 
the step. 

### Pronouns

Use gender-neutral pronouns, like “they” whenever possible. Generally, you can change any 
noun from singular to plural to have subject-verb-pronoun agreement and avoid the use of 
gender-specific pronouns like “he”, “him”, “his” or “she”, “her”, “hers”. Using "they" or 
"their" with singular nouns is more generally accepted in modern conversational English, but
it's rare you to need to use the disagreeing format in documentation.

Be wary of impersonal and potentially ambiguous pronouns such as:

- all, another, any
- each, either
- few, many, neither, none,
- one, other
- same, several, some, such
- this, that, them, these, those

If you use any of these impersonal pronouns, be sure you answer “of what?”, “of which?”, 
or “as what?” in the sentence. Be especially cautious if you start a sentence with an
indefinite pronoun like "This" followed by a verb. In most cases, the pronoun should be 
followed by an object.

## Terminology and usage conventions

This section covers common terminology, style, and usage questions.
It includes recommended practices for using punctuation, referring to user interface
elements, and selecting the right words for the information you're trying to convey. 

### Above and below

Don't use *above* to mean *earlier* or as an adjective preceding a noun (*the above section*) 
or following a noun (*the code above*). Use a hyperlink, or use *previous*, *preceding*, or 
*earlier*. Don't use *below* to mean *later* or as an adjective preceding a noun (*the below 
section*) or following a noun (*the code below*). Use a hyperlink, or use *later* or 
*the following*. For example: 

- Use the preceding code to display information about the database.
- Use the following code to display information about the database.

### Dates and numbers

Date formats can depend on context, including the location of a computer and a user's 
preferences. In most cases, you can use the DD Mon YYYY or DD Month YYYY format for dates. 
In body text, spell out whole numbers from zero through nine. Use numerals for 10 or greater. 
Use commas in numbers with four or more digits. Use *more than* instead of *over* 
(over is a spatial term). 

### Emphasis and special notices

Use bold formatting for user interface elements that the user interacts with, including:

- Menus and menu commands.
- Field and button labels.
- Options that can be selected in the user interface.

If there's text that requires more attention than the surrounding body, consider isolating 
it as a standalone note or tip. However, **think twice** before adding any type of special 
notice, embedding details, or using tabbed boxes. These elements can all be distracting and 
too many of them make text unreadable. 

Because they are generally **disruptive** to the reader's experience, ask yourself if it is 
really necessary to stop the reader's forward progress by adding a Note, Caution, Tip, or 
any other special component. In most cases, it's more effective to integrate the information 
in the main body of the text. If you use these types of components at all, use them sparingly! 

**Note**—Indicates neutral or positive information that emphasizes or supplements important 
points of the main text. A note supplies information that may apply only in special cases. 
Examples are memory limitations, equipment configurations, or details that apply to specific 
versions of a program.

**Tip**—Helps users apply the techniques and procedures described in the text to their specific 
needs. A tip suggests alternative methods that may not be obvious and helps users understand 
the benefits and capabilities of the product. A tip is not essential to the basic understanding 
of the text.

**Caution**—Advises users that failure to take or avoid a specific action could result in 
loss of data.

### Images

Diagrams and illustrations can help readers visualize and internalize complex ideas and 
processes. So, use them liberally but with intention. Images also help to break up long text 
flows, but they should always reinforce and reflect the text immediately preceding or 
immediately following the image.

If you include screenshots, only include the relevant parts of the screen and use callouts 
to highlight how what is captured in the image is relevant to the text.

Be wary of using diagrams or illustrations that include any information—visual or textual—that 
is likely to get stale.

### Log in and sign in formats

Most Linux distributions and macOS use *log in* to describe how a user initiates an interactive 
session. Windows uses *log on*. Many modern web-based applications—including the Teleport Web 
UI—use *sign in*.

- Use sign in or log in as two words with no hyphen when describing an action (verb usage).
- Use sign in and sign out as the preferred terminology when referring to actions involving 
  the Teleport Web UI.
- Use login as one word only when used as a noun, for example, when using login to mean user 
  profile or an identity.
- Use log-in with a hyphen when modifying a noun (adjective usage).

### Optional steps

Use (Optional) at the beginning of steps that are optional. For example:

- (Optional) Add a custom field.

### Punctuation

Use the guidelines in this section for punctuation marks.

| Punctuation	| Usage
| ----------- | -----
| apostrophe (') | Use in contractions for a conversational tone. Avoid using the possessive form.
| capitalization | Use sentence style capitalization for all headings. 
| colon (:) | Use a colon at the end of the statement that introduces a procedure, bulleted list, or table.
| comma (,)	| Use a serial comma to separate three or more items in a series, including the item before the conjunction. For example: She bought apples, oranges, and bananas.
| em dash (—)	| Use an em dash (—) to set off a clarifying or parenthetical phrase with more emphasis than parentheses provide. Don't add spaces around an em dash. Don't capitalize the first word after an em dash unless the word is a proper noun.
| exclamation point (!) | Avoid using exclamation points in general and never use more than one.
| hyphenation (-)	| Avoid using hyphenated compound words. Use hyphens only if the meaning is unclear without them or if the only recognized form of the word includes a hyphen.
| quotation marks (“ “)	| Avoid using quotation marks unless you need to quote a message or as string that would otherwise be confusing given its surrounding context.
| semicolons (;) | Don't use semicolons instead of commas to separate items in a list. If you think the content should use semicolons, consider rewriting it into subtopics or an unordered bullet list.
| slashes (/) and backslashes (\)	| Avoid using slashes or backslashes except when documenting paths that require either forward or backward slashes. Never use and/or in documentation.

### Software versions

Use *or later* or *and later* to refer to multiple versions of software. For example:

- Firefox 3.6 or later
- Rust compiler, version 1.55.0 and later

### Tense

Use present tense whenever possible. Use past tense only if you must describe something 
that has already occurred.
Use future tense only if you must describe something that has not yet occurred but can 
be safely assumed.

### User interface elements

In general, you should avoid writing about user interface elements themselves. Instead, 
documentation should always focus on what the audience needs to do or wants to 
accomplish—that is, the user interaction—and not the widgets displayed on the screen.

When referring to interactions in the user interface, you should generally follow the 
capitalization that is used for the element unless it is rendered as all capital letters. 
Because using all capitals is typically considered aggressive in text and most
user interface elements that use all capital letters are also text that the user interacts
with, you can break the "follow the UI rule" and use an initial capital letter.

| Element	| How to use it
| ------- | -------------
| button	| Use bold for the button label. Don't include "button" in the description. For example: Click **Submit**.
| checkbox	| Use checkbox, not box or check box, if you need to refer to a checkbox in the user interface. Use select and clear with checkboxes, not turn on and turn off, check and uncheck, or unselect and deselect.
| click	| Use click to describe taking action on a standalone button. Do not use click on. Click and select are not interchangeable.
| dialog	| If you need to refer to a dialog box, use dialog. Don't use pop-up window, dialog box, or dialogue box.
| dropdown	| Use dropdown as an adjective, not as a noun. For example, use dropdown list.
| menu | Use bold for the menu name and menu item names if the user interacts with them.

### Verb usage

Use the following guidelines for common verbs.

| Verb | How to use it
| ---- | -------------
| can, may, might	| Use the verb can when describing ability, capability, or capacity. Avoid using the verb may because it implies permission. Use the past tense might when describing the possibility or eventuality of an outcome.
| clear	| Use clear rather than deselect or unselect if you have to describe removing a selection from a checkbox.
| displays	| Use the transitive verb displays rather than the intransitive verb appears. Use displays with a direct object. For example, The command displays log messages.
| ensure	| Use ensure to mean to make sure or to guarantee. Remember that this is not interchangeable with assure (to make confident) and insure (to provide insurance).
| enter, type	| Use enter to instruct the user to input a value by pressing the Enter or Return key. Use type to instruct the user to type a value in a field.
| select	| Use select to describe taking action on a menu item, checkbox, or radio button. Note that click and select are not interchangeable.
| set up, setup	| Use set up—two words, no hyphen—when used as a verb. Don't hyphenate. Use setup—one word, no hyphen—when used as an adjective or as a noun.
| want, wish	| Use want instead of wish or desire when the user has a choice of actions.

### Word choice

| Word in question | How to use it
| ---------------- | -------------
| affect, effect	| Use affect as a verb and use effect as a noun.
| allow, enable	| Avoid using software as a point of view and consider rewriting to focus on the human interacting with the software.
| app, application	| Use application or applications unless there's a specific reason for using the shorthand term app or apps.
| back-end, front-end	| Using the hyphen in these terms is still more common than not using it. Both forms are acceptable, but for consistency use the hyphen.
| email	| It hasn't been e-mail for thirty-plus years. Never use emails. Don't use email as a verb.
| file name	| Use file name as two words, not filename.
| its, it's	| Use its as a possessive meaning belonging to or associated with an object or idea previously mentioned. Because it is a vague pronoun, be sure to check that what it refers to can be easily identified. Use it's only as a contraction for it is or it has.
| multifactor	| Use multifactor without the hyphen for multifactor authentication.
| please	| Avoid using please in documentation unless there's a specific reason for using it. For example, you might use please if quoting the content of a message that asks the user to do something inconvenient.
| prerequisite | As a section title, it's a bit stuffy and old-fashioned. Use Before you begin instead. If you use prerequisite in the text, there's no hyphen.
| that, which	| Use that at the beginning of a clause that's necessary for the sentence to make sense. Don't put a comma before that. Don't use that when introducing a clause referring to people. Use who. Use which at the beginning of a clause that adds supporting or parenthetical information to a sentence. If you can omit the clause and the sentence still makes sense, use which, and put a comma before it.
| user name, username |	Use user name as two words in most cases. However, username is acceptable to indicate a user identity profile name.

## Best practices and common mistakes

This section highlights best practices and common mistakes to avoid.

### Make every word count

Concise sentences are easier to read, comprehend, and translate.

- Use simple words with precise meanings.
- Remove words that don't add substance.
- Avoid using passive *to be verbs* like *been*, and *being*.
- Avoid weak or vague verbs, such as *have*, *make*, and *do*.

Whenever possible, choose words that have one clear meaning. When in doubt, choose the 
simple word or phrase over a more formal or complex one.
Avoid flowery language and unnecessary words whenever possible.
For example:

| Choose this | Instead of this |
| --- | --- |
| use | utilize, make use of |
| remove | extract, take away, eliminate |
| tell | inform, let know |
| to | in order to, as a means to |
| also | in addition |
| connect | establish connectivity |

Avoid adjectives and adverbs—words that describe how, when, or where. They're tempting, but 
rarely add much value. Unless they're important to the meaning of a statement, leave them out.

### Be consistent

Use one term consistently to represent one concept. 
For example, if you use tenant, cluster, and proxy interchangeably or ambiguously, you'll 
leave the reader confused and uncertain. 
If terminology changes, be prepared to root out old terminology.

If you use words that can be both nouns and verbs—for example, words like file, post, mark, 
screen, record, and report—use sentence structure and context to eliminate ambiguity.

### Avoid dangling participles

Participles are modifiers so they must have a noun to modify. A *dangling participle* is 
a participle that doesn't have a noun to modify. If you misplace or leave out the word 
being modified, you'll end up with a sentence that is difficult to understand, illogical, 
or ambiguous (though potentially amusing). Here are a few examples of sentences with 
dangling participles:

- Looking around the yard, dandelions sprouted in every corner.
- Walking through the kitchen, the smoke alarm was going off.
- Driving like a maniac, the deer was hit and killed.

You can correct these sentences by bringing the participle phrase closer to the subject 
the phrase is intended to modify or changing the word order of the sentence to clarify 
who is doing what. You can also fix these types of problems by changing the tense or 
using the active voice. For example:

- Looking around the yard, I saw dandelions had sprouted in every corner.
- As I was walking through the kitchen, the smoke alarm was going off.
- Driving like a maniac, he hit and killed the deer.

### Dangling prepositions

In modern English, it's perfectly acceptable to end a sentence with a preposition. 
Don't twist a sentence into knots just to avoid using a preposition at the end.

- This is something you might be interested in.
- This is an example you should pay attention to.

### Cross-reference formats

Most cross-references should include information that clarifies what the reader 
can expect to be found in the referenced topic.
For cross-references to topics in the Teleport documentation, use the following 
format:

- For more information about task or concept, see topic-title-link.

For cross-references in a glossary entry to other glossary entries, use the following 
format:

- See topic.

For cross-references to external resources, use the title of the destination instead 
of the URL of the destination. Avoid using links to unnamed destinations. For example, 
don't use links like click <ins>here</ins> or see this <ins>article</ins>>.

## How-to guides

A how-to guide describes how to achieve a goal or complete a task. 
Only the information that is pertinent to achieving that goal or completing the task is included. 
With how-to guides, readers have enough information to know what they want to do—for example, 
open a bank account—but not necessarily enough information to know how to do it.
For example, the how-to guide for opening a bank account wouldn't explain what a bank account 
is or why you might want to open one, but would focus on specific steps such as:

1. Select an institution.
1. Fill out an application.
1. Deposit a minimum amount of currency.
 
How-to guides often include links to additional information, but should not include 
explanations that take the focus away from what the reader wants to accomplish.

### What's in a how-to guide?

In most cases, how-to guides contain the following sections:

- Frontmatter with a guide title, description, and other information.
  The title should be short and identify the subject of the how-to topic in the fewest words possible.
  The description should be a sentence that starts with a verb and summarizes the content of the topic.
  Additional information might include a video banner link, a list of keywords, or an alternate 
  first-level heading.

- One or more introductory paragraphs that explain what the task-at-hand is, the use case or 
  scenario driving the reader to complete the task, and the expected outcome.
  Avoid recreating content if you can refer a reader to a single, separate guide. 

- Before you begin list of prerequisites.
  Actions that are common to multiple topics that must be taken before starting the procedure 
  in how-to topic are generally documented in include files and referenced in the
  list of Prerequisites. 

- Task step sections that break down the how-to procedure into manageable chunks or subtasks
  with clearly-defined goals.
  Currently, task step sections use headings that convey the current and total number of steps
  involved to complete the procedure, for example, **Step 1/3. Add a local user**.

  In most cases, task step sections include code examples, configuration settings, and 
  screenshots to illustrate the actions the read should perform. Whenever possible, readers
  should be able to copy and paste the example code and configurations with minimal changes 
  to complete the procedure being documenting.

- Next steps section can be used to add links to logically related topics, if applicable, or
  to recommend related topics for further reading, such as reference topics related to the
  procedure completed.

### Using links, admonishments, and details in how-to guides

You should avoid breaking the reader's focus in how-to guides. 
For example, avoid adding links to other pages or to other sections in the same topic.
Avoid inserting notices, tips, admonishments, or collapsed details sections unless
absolutely necessary.

If you do include a link in a how-to guide to external documentation,
be sure to tell the reader why to follow the link and what information to glean from it.
For example, use explicit information like "Follow the installation instructions in the 
AWS documentation" instead of "Read the AWS documentation for more information".

## Tutorials

Tutorials—and, to some extent, Getting started guides—are designed to give first-time 
Teleport users hands-on experience completing a set of explicit instructions. Tutorials 
should be as simple and straightforward as possible. Tutorials must provide a positive 
learning experience and a successful outcome with no unexpected behavior or unexplained 
errors. It's okay for a tutorial to include a red herring to illustrate a common misstep 
but the author must provide a sufficient explanation of the error and how to correct it.

### What's in a tutorial?

Tutorial or getting started guides contain much of the same content as how-to guides 
but are focused on achieving learning objectives:

- Frontmatter with a demo video to reach readers who prefer video.
- One or more introductory paragraphs that explain what the tutorial demonstrates.
- Before you begin list of the tools required to complete the tutorial.
- Learning objectives that summarize what the reader will accomplish by completing the tutorial.
- Task steps that the reader must follow in sequence to successfully complete the lesson.
- Next steps section can be used to add links to logically related topics, if applicable, or
  to recommend related topics for further reading, such as reference topics related to the
  procedure completed.

## Conceptual guides

**Conceptual guides** and **Architecture guides** explain core concepts and how Teleport works
at system, component, and operational levels.
Guide for conceptual and architectural information can include the following types of topics:

- **Networking** for audiences interested in networking concepts, components, and protocols.
- **Security** for audiences interested in security protocols, cryptographic primitives, and 
  reducing attack vectors.
- **Deployment** for audiences interested in deployment architecture.

### Reference manuals

**Reference manuals** provide an exhaustive list of configuration options, API methods, 
and other possible fields and values for the various ways in which users can interact with 
Teleport.

- Should be comprehensive. If listing configuration options, API paths, and so on, list 
  all of them, rather than a few examples.
- HTML or Markdown tables are often the best formats for this kind of article.
- Should be easy to navigate with a browser's search functionality. List all content on 
  the same page.
- Should avoid prose and be expressed with brevity.

## Teleport-specific styles

Many style rules have equally justifiable alternatives. Following a common style guide 
is intended to prevent debates over style questions from getting in the way of 
documenting Teleport. If you don't see an answer to a style question in this guide, 
follow your best judgement and keep the style you choose consistent within the 
page you're working on to maintain a professional polish.

### Tone

The documentation should be technically precise and directed toward a generally 
technical audience, for example, application developers, site reliability engineers, 
and security engineering team leads. 

Even when describing Teleport generally, emphasize specific technical capabilities 
over broad statements of benefit. The aim is not to pique the audience's interest, but 
to provide information.

For example, rather than:

```markdown
Teleport replaces insecure secrets with true identity.
```

Use:

```markdown
Teleport replaces shared secrets with short-lived X.509 and SSH certificates.
```

Some guides are intended for end users seeking to access resources in their
cluster. For certain use cases, it may be necessary to adjust our usual voice
for the audience of a specific guide.

### Code, commands, and configuration

- `tsh`, `tctl`, and other core commands should be placed in backticks.

- All ports or values should be enclosed in backticks, for example, `443`.

- Put shell commands and scripts into full-line code snippets so that 
  they render with a Copy button. For example:

   ```code
   $ echo "This is an example."
   ```

### Diagrams

- Use the [Teleport Lucidchart library](https://app.lucidchart.com/lucidchart/dfcf1f4a-5cf0-4758-8ebb-f6ea86900aba/edit) to create diagrams with a consistent design language.
- Diagram multistep sections using sequence diagrams that depict steps linearly.
- Several examples are available here: https://gravitational.slab.com/posts/diagrams-ix9nzhpd.

### Product names

- Full product names are treated as proper nouns and capitalized. 
  For example, Teleport Auth Service and Teleport Proxy Service are proper nouns.
  The terms proxy and service are common words and not proper nouns.
  In general, avoid capitalizing terms and features. For example, don't capitalize 
  common terms like server, node, agent, and so on. Overuse of capitalization
  makes text more difficult to read.
- Don't use quotes to refer to product names.
- Product proper nouns should be bolded on first use.

### Technical concepts and acronyms

- Avoid using acronyms whenever possible.
- If you use acronyms, be consistent and use the same acronym for any given
  concept throughout the entire page. For example, don't use a combination 
  of "multifactor", "2-factor," "two-factor", "2fa," or "tfa" within a given page.
- Always use the full definition followed by the acronym in parentheses before using 
  the acronym thereafter. For example, use "Network Level Authentication (NLA)"", not
  "NLA (Network Level Authentication)"" or "NLA" on its own without its full definition. 

### Page titles

- Should follow a `Title Name | Teleport Docs` format. The `| Teleport Docs` suffix 
  is added automatically by the static site generator.
- The total character count should not exceed 70 for the entire title since this can 
  impact SEO. Including the suffix `| Teleport Docs`, that leaves 55 characters for 
  the article's title.

### SEO

- Every page should have a clearly-worded description that summarizes the content.
- Descriptions should start with a verb and end with a period.
- Description should include common keywords related to the subject matter whenever 
  possible. 
- Use keywords liberally throughout the article.

### Videos

- If you use macOS, you can record short videos with the Quicktime
 Cmd-Shift-5 key combination and embed the video in a page with the following
 Markdown:

  ![quicktime](../../../img/docs/quicktime.webp)

- Convert `.mov` videos to `.mp4` and `webm`.

  Quicktime outputs large `.mov` files. Use `ffmpeg` to convert them into `mp4` and `webm`
  web-friendly formats:

  ```code
  # create MP4
  $ ffmpeg -i input.mov -b:v 0 -crf 25 output.mp4
  # create WebM
  $ ffmpeg -i input.mov -c vp9 -b:v 0 -crf 41 output.webm
  ```
