---

The Teleport Access Platform is a suite of software and managed services that
delivers on-demand, least-privileged access to infrastructure on a foundation of
cryptographic identity and Zero Trust, with built-in identity security and
policy governance.

## Use cases

Organizations use the Teleport Access Platform to:

- **Eliminate infrastructure and access silos:** Teleport provides a single
  system for role-based access controls, audit, and access for all of your
  infrastructure, from cloud provider APIs to Kubernetes clusters.
- **Introduce Zero Trust with theft-resistant credentials:** Teleport
  authenticates access to all of your infrastructure with short-lived
  certificates, verified at every endpoint. You can roll out a Zero Trust
  strategy for your organization by setting up Teleport alone.
- **Address complex compliance needs:** Teleport allows you to satisfy
  compliance frameworks like SOC 2 and FedRAMP with no need for additional
  tooling or process changes. 

## Products

The Teleport Access Platform consists of three products:

- **Teleport Access** provides on-demand, least privileged access, on a
  foundation of cryptographic identity and Zero Trust.
- **Teleport Identity** hardens your infrastructure with identity governance and
  security.
- **Teleport Policy** unifies and controls access policies across all of your
  infrastructure.  

### Teleport Access

**Teleport Access** provides Zero Trust connectivity to all of your
infrastructure. You can enable users to access servers, databases, and other
infrastructure components over the public internet, even if those components are
protected behind a firewall. 

All infrastructure resources belong to a unified inventory, with a single
role-based access controls system to allow for least-privilege access. You can
enable users to authenticate to resources using Single Sign-On providers like
GitHub and Google Workspace. Connectivity takes place through short-lived
credentials that Teleport components verify through strong cryptographic
techniques.

Get started with Teleport Access by enrolling resources in your cluster:

- [Servers](server-access/introduction.mdx)
- [Databases](database-access/introduction.mdx)
- [Kubernetes clusters](kubernetes-access/introduction.mdx)
- [Windows desktops](desktop-access/introduction.mdx)
- [Applications](application-access/introduction.mdx)

### Teleport Identity

**Teleport Identity** is an add-on to Teleport Access that offers identity
governance and security for all of your infrastructure. You can provide users
less-privileged roles by default, requiring any user who wants additional
permissions to request them for a limited time. This approach leaves no
permanent admin roles for attackers to target. 

As an additional layer of protection against phishing and exfiltration, you can
restrict access to users with trusted devices. And during active security
incidents, you can lock down specific users, roles, infrastructure resources and
more, letting you contain the security incident with minimal disruption. An
audit log provides visibility into access patterns, so you can identify weak
restrictions and potential security breaches.

- [Device Trust](./access-controls/device-trust.mdx)
- [Access Monitoring](./access-controls/access-monitoring.mdx)
- [Session & Identity Locks](./access-controls/guides/locking.mdx)
- [Jamf Endpoint
  Management](./access-controls/device-trust/jamf-integration.mdx)

### Teleport Policy

**Teleport Policy** unifies and controls access policies across all of your
infrastructure. With Teleport Access Graph, you can get insight into role-based
access control policies, including in Teleport and your cloud provider.

## Architecture

The Teleport Access Platform consists of a certificate authority and
identity-aware access proxy that run either on the Teleport-managed cloud or, in
special cases, a self-hosted private network. 

Teleport Agents, which the user deploys on Linux servers or Kubernetes, proxy
access to infrastructure resources and cloud provider APIs. Users authenticate
to infrastructure resources through Teleport agents using short-lived
certificates. Certificates indicate Teleport role membership, allowing Teleport
Agents to enforce role-based access-controls.
