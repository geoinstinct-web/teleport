description: Describes common issues and solutions for access to servers.

This section describes common issues that you might encounter in managing access to servers
with Teleport and how to work around or resolve them.

## Error starting session due to teleport file settings

Teleport should be set with "-rwxr-xr-x" since it is run as the user that is starting a ssh session. 
Some systems will configure new installations it so it is not executable by any user.  
See https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/19943.

- No users set for logins when converting to SSO. Our instructions show adding a user and setting a login.  
SSO users will login often with no set logins so that leads to confusion why they don't see.  
The fix is to hardcode or use traits in the roles.

- A server listing does not mean it is actually available. 
A server will list ~10m and sometimes more after the last heartbeat.  
If a server is coming back as unavailable the "tctl nodes ls --format json" or "tsh ls --format json" 
will show the expiration date.  If the expiration is
showing low numbers that means the heartbeat isn't coming through.  LIkely that the node has stopped heartbeating.

- Attempts to join sessions are failing.  This requires role permission.
