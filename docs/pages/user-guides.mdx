Teleport is a complex security solution, and most of our documentation covers
the installation, configuration, and management of Teleport for administrators.
For end users, this page covers the basics of authenticating to Teleport and
accessing resources.

## tsh

`tsh` lets you authenticate to Teleport, list services, and initate either
direct connections or proxy tunnels to them. After [downloading](/downloads)
and installing `tsh`, sign in to your Teleport cluster:

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>

```code
$ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=alice
Enter password for Teleport user alice:
Tap any security key
> Profile URL:        https://teleport.example.com:443
  Logged in as:       alice
  Cluster:            example.com
  Roles:              access
  Logins:             root, ubuntu, ec2-user
  Kubernetes:         enabled
  Valid until:        2022-11-01 22:37:05 -0500 CDT [valid for 12h0m0s]
  Extensions:         permit-agent-forwarding, permit-port-forwarding, permit-pty, private-key-policy
```

</ScopedBlock>

<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>

```code
$ tsh login --proxy=mytenant.teleport.sh --user=alice
Enter password for Teleport user alice:
Tap any security key
> Profile URL:        https://teleport.example.com:443
  Logged in as:       alice
  Cluster:            mytennant.teleport.sh
  Roles:              access
  Logins:             root, ubuntu, ec2-user
  Kubernetes:         enabled
  Valid until:        2022-11-01 22:37:05 -0500 CDT [valid for 12h0m0s]
  Extensions:         permit-agent-forwarding, permit-port-forwarding, permit-pty, private-key-policy
```

</ScopedBlock>

Depending on how Teleport was configured for your network, you may need
additional flags, such as `--auth=a_saml_connector`. Your administrator should
provde the details required for your particular use case.

## Teleport Connect

The Teleport Connect app provides all the same access to resources as `tsh` and
more, in a friendly graphic user interface. After
[downloading](https://goteleport.com/download/) and installing Teleport Connect,
you can log in initiate sessions for Server and Database Access all, within a
single window.

1. Click **CONNECT** to connect to the Teleport cluster:

   ![A new instance of Teleport Connect](../img/teleport-connect-init.png)

2. Provide the address of your Teleport Cluster (e.g. 
<ScopedBlock scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>`https://teleport.example.com`</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>`https://mytennant.teleport.sh`</ScopedBlock>
) and click **NEXT**.

3. Teleport Connect will ask you for your username, password, and MFA. If this
Teleport plane is integrated with an external Identity Provider (**IdP**), it
may instead prompt you to authenticate in a browser window with that service.

4. Once authenticated, you can browse and connect to all the resources your
user is permitted to access:

## Server Access

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="tsh">

`tsh ls` lists the servers you have access to through Server Access (ssh):

```code
$ tsh ls
Node Name           Address         Labels                       
------------------- --------------- ---------------------------- 
server1.example.com 192.0.2.24:3022 access=servers,hostname=server1
server2.example.com 192.0.2.32:3022 access=servers,hostname=server2
```

To connect to a server:

```code
$ tsh ssh ubuntu@server1.example.com
ubuntu@server1:~$
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Teleport Connect">

Under the **Servers** tab, click **CONNECT** next to the server you want to
access. Select or type in a username available to your Teleport user.

In a new tab, Teleport Connect will initiate the connection and provide a terminal environment.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Transferring files

`tsh scp` will let you transfer files to servers behind Teleport:

```code
$ tsh scp somefile.ext xeon.tp.alexf.xyz:
somefile.ext   7% |███████                | (25/342 MB, 2.9 MB/s) [9s:1m48s]
```

## Kubernetes Access

To see the Kubernetes clusters that you can access via Teleport, run the
following command:

```code
$ tsh kube ls
 Kube Cluster Name Labels                      Selected
 ----------------- --------------------------- --------
 mycluster         env=dev
```

To log in to the cluster, run the following command, changing `mycluster` to the
name of a Kubernetes cluster as it was listed in `tsh kube ls`:

```code
$ tsh kube login mycluster
Logged into kubernetes cluster "mycluster". Try 'kubectl version' to test the
connection.
```

When you log in to your Teleport cluster via `tsh kube login`, `tsh` updates
your kubeconfig to point to your chosen Kubernetes cluster. You can then run
`kubectl` commands against your cluster.

## Database Access

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="tsh">

`tsh db ls` will list the databases available to your user:

```code
$ tsh db ls
Name                                               Description Allowed Users   Labels  Connect
-----------------------------------------------    ----------- --------------- ------- -------------------------
myelastic                                                      [alice elastic] env=dev
mysql-server1 (user: alice, db: teleport_example)              [alice elastic] env=dev tsh db connect mysql-server1
```

To connect to a database server, through `tsh`, you'll need a local client for
that database. For example, to connect to a MySQL or MariaDB database, you'll
need the [MySQL CLI](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql.html) client:

```code
tsh db connect --db-user=alice --db-name=teleport_example mysql-server1 
```

In this example, `teleport_example` is a pre-existing database on the MySQL server:

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
| teleport_example   |
+--------------------+
4 rows in set (0.09 sec)
```

For other connection types, or to connect a graphic database client, you can create a local tunnel to point your software to:

```code
$ tsh proxy db myelastic --db-user=alice --tunnel
Started authenticated tunnel for the Elasticsearch database "myelastic" in cluster "example.come" on 192.0.2.58:52669.

Use one of the following commands to connect to the database:

  * interactive SQL connection:

  $ elasticsearch-sql-cli http://localhost:52669/

  * run single request with curl:

  $ curl http://localhost:52669/

Database certificate renewed: valid until 2022-11-02T06:11:50Z [valid for 9h55m0s]
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Teleport Connect">

In the **Databases** tab, select the database you want to access and click
**CONNECT**. Select or type in a username available to your Teleport user.

Teleport Connect will open a tunneled connection to the database. You can copy the port number and connect with a GUI app at `localhost`, or click **RUN** to initiate a CLI connection inside Teleport Connect:

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Desktop Access

Desktop Access is available through the Teleport web UI. In your browser,
navigate to your Telport cluster (e.g. 
<ScopedBlock scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>`https://teleport.example.com`</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>`https://mytennant.teleport.sh`</ScopedBlock>
). From the menu on the right, select <Icon name="desktop" inline size="sm"/> **Desktops**. Next to the desktop you want to access, click **CONNECT**. Select
or type in a username available to your Teleport user. Teleport will open a new
browser tab or window and begin the RDP session. Note that you may need to wait
a moment for Teleport to log you in as the specified user.

## Next Steps

This page is a basic introduction to using Teleport. More detailed information
on the subject matter covered here can be found in the **Connect your Client**
section of our docs:

- `tsh` is the primary CLI tool for Server Access through Teleport. With it,
you can authenticate to Teleport, list available services, and connect to them
either directly or through proxy tunnels.

   Learn more about it from [Using the tsh Command Line Tool](./connect-your-client/tsh.mdx).

- Teleport Connect is a graphic utility for connecting to resources through
Teleport. You can initaite Server Access, connect to databases, and start
Desktop Acesss sessions. See [Using Teleport Connect](./connect-your-client/teleport-connect.mdx).

- [Database Access GUI Clients](./connect-your-client/gui-clients.mdx) details
how to connect many popular database GUI clients through Teleport.
