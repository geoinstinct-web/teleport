<Admonition type="tip" title="First time trying Teleport?">
If you are new to Teleport, we recommend following our [getting started guides](getting-started.mdx).
</Admonition>

## Supported operating systems

The Teleport daemon [`teleport`](./setup/reference/cli.mdx#teleport) and admin
tool [`tctl`](./setup/reference/cli.mdx#tctl) have been designed to run on
**Linux** and **macOS** operating systems. The Teleport user client
[`tsh`](./setup/reference/cli.mdx#tsh) and Web UI are available for **Linux,
macOS**, and **Windows** operating systems.

## Linux

The following examples install the 64-bit version of Teleport binaries, but
32-bit (i386) and ARM binaries are also available. Check the
[Downloads](https://goteleport.com/download/) page for the most up-to-date
information.

(!docs/pages/includes/install-linux.mdx!)

## Docker

Please follow
[Getting started with Teleport using Docker](./setup/guides/docker.mdx) or
[Teleport Enterprise using Docker](enterprise/getting-started.mdx#run-teleport-enterprise-using-docker)
for installation and setup instructions.

```code
$ docker pull (=teleport.latest_oss_docker_image=)
```

## Helm

Please follow our
[Getting Started with Kubernetes Access](./kubernetes-access/getting-started.mdx)
or
[Helm Chart Readme](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/tree/master/examples/chart/teleport)
for installation and setup instructions.

```code
$ helm repo add teleport https://charts.releases.teleport.dev
```

## MacOS

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Download">
    [Download MacOS .pkg installer](https://goteleport.com/teleport/download?os=mac) (tsh client only, signed) file, double-click to run the Installer.

    <Admonition type="note">
      This method only installs the `tsh` client for interacting with Teleport clusters.
      If you need the `teleport` server or `tctl` admin tool, use the "Terminal" method instead.
    </Admonition>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Homebrew">
    ```code
    $ brew install teleport
    ```

    <Admonition type="note">
      The Teleport package in Homebrew is not maintained by Teleport and we can't
      guarantee its reliability or security. We recommend the use of our [official
      Teleport packages](https://goteleport.com/teleport/download?os=mac).
    </Admonition>

    <Admonition type="note">
      If you choose to use Homebrew, you must verify that the versions of `tsh` and
      `tctl` are compatible with the versions you run server-side.  Homebrew usually
      ships the latest release of Teleport, which may be incompatible with older
      versions.  See our [compatibility
      policy](./setup/operations/upgrading.mdx) for details.
    </Admonition>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Terminal">
    ```code
    $ curl -O https://get.gravitational.com/teleport-(=teleport.version=).pkg
    $ sudo installer -pkg teleport-(=teleport.version=).pkg -target / # Installs on Macintosh HD
    # Password:
    # installer: Package name is teleport-(=teleport.version=)
    # installer: Upgrading at base path /
    # installer: The upgrade was successful.
    $ which teleport
    # /usr/local/bin/teleport
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Windows (tsh client only)

The `teleport` and `tctl` tools require Linux or macOS, but the `tsh` client
binary is available on Windows starting with Teleport v3.0.1.

Starting with Teleport v7.2.0, most `tsh` features are supported for Windows 10
1607+. The `tsh ssh` command can be run under `cmd.exe`, PowerShell, and Windows
Terminal.

  <TabItem label="Powershell">
    ```code
    $ curl https://get.gravitational.com/teleport-v(=teleport.version=)-windows-amd64-bin.zip.sha256
    # <checksum> <filename>
    $ curl -O teleport-v(=teleport.version=)-windows-amd64-bin.zip https://get.gravitational.com/teleport-v(=teleport.version=)-windows-amd64-bin.zip
    $ echo %PATH% # Edit %PATH% if necessary
    $ certUtil -hashfile teleport-v(=teleport.version=)-windows-amd64-bin.zip SHA256
    # SHA256 hash of teleport-v(=teleport.version=)-windows-amd64-bin.zip:
    # <checksum> <filename>
    # CertUtil: -hashfile command completed successfully.
    # Verify that the checksums match
    # Move `tsh` to your %PATH%
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Building from source

Teleport is written in Go, and currently requires **go v(=teleport.golang=)** or
newer. Detailed instructions for building from source are available in the
[README](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport#building-teleport).


## Checksums

SHA256 checksums are available for all downloads on our
[downloads page](https://goteleport.com/download/) should you wish to verify the
integrity of the download.

![Teleport Checksum](../img/teleport-sha.png)

If you download Teleport via an automated system, you can programmatically
obtain the checksum by adding `.sha256` to the download link. This is the method
shown in the installation examples.

```code
$ export version=v(=teleport.version=)
$ export os=linux # 'darwin' 'linux' or 'windows'
$ export arch=amd64 # '386' 'arm' on linux or 'amd64' for all distros
$ curl https://get.gravitational.com/teleport-$version-$os-$arch-bin.tar.gz.sha256
# <checksum> <filename>
```

## Operating System support

Teleport is officially supported on the platforms listed below. It is worth noting
that the open-source community has been successful in building and running Teleport on UNIX variants other than Linux \[1].

| Operating System | Teleport Client | Teleport Server |
| - | - | - |
| Linux v2.6.23+ | yes | yes |
| MacOS v10.12+ | yes | yes |
| Windows \[2] | yes \[2] | no |

\[1] *Teleport is written in Go and it's possible to build it on
any OS supported by the [Golang toolchain](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/MinimumRequirements)*.

\[2] *Teleport server does not run on Windows yet, but `tsh` (the Teleport client)
supports most features on Windows 10 and later.*
