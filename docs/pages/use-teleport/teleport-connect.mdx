Teleport Connect provides easy and secure access to SSH servers and databases, with support for
other resources such as Kubernetes clusters and application access coming in the future.

## Installation & Upgrade

Head over to the [Downloads](https://goteleport.com/download/) page to download the most recent
version of Teleport Connect. As of now, Teleport Connect supports macOS only. Double-click the
downloaded .dmg file and drag the Teleport Connect icon to the Applications folder.

To upgrade Teleport Connect to a newer version, download the .dmg file with that version and follow
the installation steps.

## Interface Overview

![interface overview of Teleport Connect](../../img/use-teleport/connect-ui-overview.png)

The top bar of Teleport Connect consists of:

- The profile selector (the top right) allowing you to switch between profiles on different Teleport
  clusters as well as log in or out of the clusters.
- The connection list (the top left) showing recent connections, allowing you to seamlessly switch
  between them.
- The command bar (in the middle) which launches any command you input in a new terminal tab.
- The cluster selector (to the left of the command bar) shows up only if there are leaf clusters
  connected to the root cluster. It lets you browse leaf cluster resources. It also changes
  which cluster the commands in the command bar are going to target.

## Connecting to an SSH Server

1. Open a tab with cluster resources by clicking on the plus symbol at the end of the tab bar. You
   can also press `Cmd + T` to achieve the same result.
2. Look for the SSH server you want to connect to and click the Connect button to the right.
3. Select or enter the login you wish to use and press `Enter`.
4. A new tab will open with a shell session on the chosen server.

Alternatively, you can type `tsh ssh` into the command bar and the autocompletion will guide you to
connect to a server.

## Connecting to a Database

1. Open a tab with cluster resources by clicking on the plus symbol at the end of the tab bar. You
   can also press `Cmd + T` to achieve the same result.
2. Select the Databases section.
3. Look for the database server you wish to connect to and click the Connect button to the right.
4. Select or enter the database user you with to use and press `Enter`.
5. A new tab will open with a new connection established between your device and the database
   server.

This connection will remain active until you click the Close Connection button or close Teleport
Connect. The port number will persist between app restarts â€“ you can set up your favorite client
without worrying about the port suddenly changing.

### With a GUI Client

To connect with a GUI client, follow the instructions in the database connection tab under the
Connect with GUI section.

### With a CLI Client

The database connection tab shows the command that can be used to connect to the database. You can
modify the database name of the connection and then click the Run button to open a new
terminal tab with that command executed.

## Connecting to Multiple Clusters

After you add your first cluster, you can keep adding more by opening the profile selector in the
top right and clicking at the *+ Add another cluster* button.

At the moment Teleport Connect supports only one user per cluster. To log in as a different user,
log out of the cluster first.

## Restarting and Reconnecting

Teleport Connect remembers the tabs that you had open and will ask you on restart if you want to
reopen them. If you agree, Connect will restore connections to all resources that were active before
you closed the app.

At the moment terminal tabs are restored only as far as the working directory is concerned. Teleport
Connect doesn't attempt to re-execute commands that were in progress when the app was closed.

## Troubleshooting

In an attempt to resolve issues with a cluster you can try logging out of it, closing the app and
logging in again.

To force the app to log you out of all clusters, close the app and remove the `~/Library/Application
Support/Teleport Connect/tsh` folder. Removing the file under `~/Library/Application
Support/Teleport Connect/app_state.json` will clear all remembered tabs and connections.

### Submitting an Issue

To submit an issue, click the Submit Feedback button at the bottom right (the speech bubble symbol)
and follow the Submit a Bug link.

Be sure to attach logs which can be found under `~/Library/Application Support/Teleport
Connect/logs`.

### Updating local shell environment

Teleport Connect updates the environment variables on app restart and not when starting a new shell
session.
