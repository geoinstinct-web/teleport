title: Using PuTTY to connect to SSH nodes via Teleport
description: This reference shows you how to use PuTTY to connect to SSH nodes through Teleport
---

This guide will show you how to use the Teleport client tool `tsh` to add saved sessions for use
with [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/), and then how to use PuTTY as a client to connect to SSH nodes.

You will learn how to:

- Generate saved PuTTY sessions for SSH nodes attached to a Teleport cluster.
- Log in to an interactive shell using these saved PuTTY sessions.


## Prerequisites

- A client machine running Windows 10 or higher. You can only use `tsh` to save PuTTY sessions on Windows.

- The Teleport `tsh.exe` client, version 14.0.0 or higher. To download the `tsh.exe` client, run the following command:

  ```code
  $ curl.exe -O https://cdn.teleport.dev/teleport-v(=teleport.version=)-windows-amd64-bin.zip
  ```

  You should then unzip the archive and move `tsh.exe` to your `%PATH%`.

- PuTTY for Windows version 0.78 or higher. You can download the latest version of PuTTY from the [PuTTY download page](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).


## Summary

To add saved sessions to PuTTY:

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss","enterprise"]}>

1. Sign into a Teleport cluster using the `tsh login` command:

```bash
C:\Users\gus>tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com
```

This command retrieves your user certificates and saves them in a local file in the `%USERPROFILE%/.tsh` directory.

2. List SSH nodes that the user can connect to inside the cluster:

```bash
C:\Users\gus>tsh ls
Node Name                           Address        Labels
----------------------------------- -------------- ----------------------------
ip-172-31-30-140                    127.0.0.1:3022 company=acmecorp,env=aws,...
ip-172-31-34-128.us-east-2.compu... ⟵ Tunnel      access=open,enhanced_reco...
```

3. Add a saved session for a specific login on a specific node to the Windows registry.

For example, you can add a saved session for the login `ubuntu` on the node `ip-172-31-30-140` to the Windows
registry by running the following command:

```bash
C:\Users\gus>tsh puttyconfig ubuntu@ip-172-31-30-140
Added PuTTY session for ubuntu@ip-172-31-30-140 [proxy:teleport.example.com]
```

If you don't provide a login to this command, your local Windows username is used instead.

</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>

1. Sign into a Teleport cluster using the `tsh login` command:

```bash
C:\Users\gus>tsh login --proxy=mytenant.teleport.sh
```

This command retrieves your user certificates and saves them in a local file in the `%USERPROFILE%/.tsh` directory.

2. List SSH nodes that the user can connect to inside the cluster:

```
C:\Users\gus>tsh ls
Node Name                           Address        Labels
----------------------------------- -------------- ----------------------------
ip-172-31-30-140                    ⟵ Tunnel      company=acmecorp,env=aws,...
ip-172-31-34-128.us-east-2.compu... ⟵ Tunnel      access=open,enhanced_reco...
```

3. Add a saved session for a specific login on a specific node to the Windows registry.

For example, you can add a saved session for the login `ubuntu` on the node `ip-172-31-30-140` to the Windows
registry by running the following command:

```bash
C:\Users\gus>tsh puttyconfig ubuntu@ip-172-31-30-140
Added PuTTY session for ubuntu@ip-172-31-30-140 [proxy:mytenant.teleport.sh]
```

If you don't provide a login to this command, your local Windows username is used instead.

## Use a saved session to connect with PuTTY

1. Start PuTTY to see the saved sessions available for your cluster.

<Figure width="452" height="437" caption="Main PuTTY window">
![Main PuTTY window](../../img/connect-your-client/putty-window.png)
</Figure>

2. Double-click a session to connect to the host through Teleport.

<Figure width="661" height="418" caption="PuTTY console">
![PuTTY console](../../img/connect-your-client/putty-console.png)
</Figure>

After you connect to the host, Teleport generates an audit log entry for the session's start,
and appears in the list of "Active Sessions" within Teleport.

You can run `teleport status` inside the session to verify that it is connected through
the Teleport proxy and to output the session's UUID for tracking purposes.
If session recording is enabled for your cluster, you can also view a
recording of the session after you stop the session and disconnect from the host.


## Leaf clusters

To list available leaf clusters, run the following command:

```bash
C:\Users\gus>tsh clusters
Cluster Name         Status Cluster Type Labels Selected
-----------------    ------ ------------ ------ --------
teleport.example.com online root                *
example.teleport.sh  online leaf
```

You can access a leaf cluster in a PuTTY session by adding the `--leaf <leaf cluster name>` parameter to the `tsh puttyconfig` command.

For example, if your leaf cluster is named `example.teleport.sh` and your node is called `ip-172-31-34-128.us-east-2.compute.internal`,
you can add a PuTTY session for the login `ec2-user` using the following command:

```bash
C:\Users\gus>tsh puttyconfig --leaf example.teleport.sh ec2-user@ip-172-31-34-128.us-east-2.compute.internal
Added PuTTY session for ec2-user@ip-172-31-34-128.us-east-2.compute.internal [leaf:example.teleport.sh,proxy:teleport.example.com]
```


## Session naming

Sessions are named using the following schema:

Root clusters: `<login>@<hostname> [proxy:<proxy address>]`

Leaf clusters: `<login>@<hostname> [leaf:<leaf cluster name>,proxy:<proxy address>]`

## Frequently asked questions

### Do I need administrator rights on my machine to run `tsh puttyconfig`?

No, `tsh` only makes changes to the `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` registry key.

### Can I add saved PuTTY sessions for all users on a machine?

No, sessions are only added for the current user. You can export the sessions for another user to import using the
registry export method described below.

### Can I export my saved PuTTY sessions to another machine?

Yes, use the Registry Editor to export the `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY` registry key to a file
and import this file on another machine. Note that you will need admin rights to run Registry Editor.

### Can I change the font size, window size, or other preference for my saved PuTTY sessions?

After a session has been added, you can make changes to it in the PuTTY UI by clicking the session name in the
"Saved sessions" list, then clicking **Load**. Make all the necessary changes, then choose the session again and click **Save**.

### If I re-run `tsh puttyconfig` for a given host, will it overwrite any custom changes I've made to the saved session?

Teleport only modifies the configuration parameters that it relies on, like the proxy name, proxy command, hostname, username, and so on.
Any changes to font size, window size, and other parameters are left untouched.

### Can I use other graphical clients like MobaXterm or SecureCRT?

Only PuTTY support is implemented at present. Most other graphical clients do not fully support the use of both SSH user
certificates and SSH host certificates for authentication which is a requirement to use Teleport.

Please contact the authors of those clients if you wish to see support for Teleport sessions added.

### Can I use forks of PuTTY like KiTTY or Solar PuTTY?

If the fork uses PuTTY 0.78 or higher as its base, it may work. However, the Teleport team only tests stock versions of PuTTY
and cannot provide support for forked versions.

### Can I use my saved Teleport PuTTY sessions with WinSCP?

At the time of writing, WinSCP doesn't support validation using host certificates. Because Teleport requires host
certificate validation, you can't yet use WinSCP to connect to a host through Teleport.

You can track the status of this feature request and vote for it on the WinSCP bug tracker: https://winscp.net/tracker/2145

### Can I use an alternative Teleport authentication method (`tsh login --auth`) with saved sessions?

No, PuTTY calls `tsh proxy ssh` which uses the default authentication method configured for the Teleport cluster.

For more information about Teleport authentication, see [Authentication options](../reference/authentication.mdx).

Advanced users can use the Registry Editor to modify the PuTTY proxy command themselves under the `ProxyTelnetCommand`
key. Note that if you re-run `tsh puttyconfig` for the given hostname, this command is overwritten.


## Troubleshooting

### `proxy: ERROR: access denied to <user> connecting to <proxy>`

You have provided an incorrect login username to the `tsh puttyconfig` command. Re-run the command with a login username
that your Teleport user/role has permissions to use. Check the logins listed under the `logins` role specification or user trait.

If you can log in successfully with `tsh ssh`, you should be able to use the name login/hostname with `tsh puttyconfig`.

### `proxy: ERROR: ssh: subsystem request failed`

The Teleport proxy is unable to connect to the given host/port provided in the saved session. This may mean that the node is
offline. Check that the node is visible in `tsh ls` and that you can connect to it with `tsh ssh login@hostname`. If this is
successful, check the Teleport proxy logs for more detailed errors.

### `Unable to use certificate file "C:\Users\<username>\.tsh\keys\<proxy>\<user>-ssh\<cluster>-cert.pub" (unable to open file)`

You are not logged into Teleport correctly. Run `tsh login --proxy=<proxy hostname>` to get valid certificates before
trying to start a PuTTY saved session.

Note that if you are using a saved session for a leaf cluster using a root cluster's proxy, you must log into the root cluster
itself to be able to start a session against the leaf cluster.

### `ERROR: No proxy address specified, missed --proxy flag?`

You do not have valid `tsh` credentials locally. Run `tsh login --proxy=<proxy hostname>` to log in first, or provide the `--proxy`
parameter when running `tsh puttyconfig`.
