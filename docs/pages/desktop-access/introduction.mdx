Teleport manages graphical desktop access to remote hosts. With Teleport, you
get:

- A password-less login experience backed by strong cryptographic
  authentication.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for groups of hosts and users.
- Support for copying and pasting to and from remote hosts.
- Audit log and recording of all desktop connections.
