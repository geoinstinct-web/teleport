## teleport.yaml

Teleport uses the YAML file format for configuration. A full configuration reference
file is shown below, this provides comments and all available options for `teleport.yaml`
By default, it is stored in `/etc/teleport.yaml`.


```yaml
# By default, this file should be stored in /etc/teleport.yaml

# This section of the configuration file applies to all teleport
# services.
teleport:
    # nodename allows to assign an alternative name this node can be reached by.
    # by default it's equal to hostname
    nodename: graviton

    # Data directory where Teleport daemon keeps its data.
    # See "Filesystem Layout" section above for more details.
    data_dir: /var/lib/teleport

    # Invitation token used to join a cluster. it is not used on
    # subsequent starts
    auth_token: xxxx-token-xxxx

    # Optional CA pin of the auth server. This enables more secure way of adding new
    # nodes to a cluster. See "Adding Nodes" section above.
    ca_pin: "sha256:7e12c17c20d9cb504bbcb3f0236be3f446861f1396dcbb44425fe28ec1c108f1"

    # When running in multi-homed or NATed environments Teleport nodes need
    # to know which IP it will be reachable at by other nodes
    #
    # This value can be specified as FQDN e.g. host.example.com
    advertise_ip: 10.1.0.5

    # list of auth servers in a cluster. you will have more than one auth server
    # if you configure teleport auth to run in HA configuration.
    # If adding a node located behind NAT, use the Proxy URL. e.g.
    #  auth_servers:
    #     - teleport-proxy.example.com:3080
    auth_servers:
        - 10.1.0.5:3025
        - 10.1.0.6:3025

    # Teleport throttles all connections to avoid abuse. These settings allow
    # you to adjust the default limits
    connection_limits:
        max_connections: 1000
        max_users: 250

    # Logging configuration. Possible output values to disk via '/var/lib/teleport/teleport.log',
    # 'stdout', 'stderr' and 'syslog'. Possible severity values are INFO, WARN
    # and ERROR (default).

    # Configuration for the storage back-end used for the cluster state and the
    # audit log. Several back-end types are supported. See "High Availability"
    # section of this Admin Manual below to learn how to configure DynamoDB,
    # S3, etcd and other highly available back-ends.
    storage:
        # By default teleport uses the `data_dir` directory on a local filesystem
        type: dir

        # List of locations where the audit log events will be stored. By default,
        # they are stored in `/var/lib/teleport/log`
        # When specifying multiple destinations like this, make sure that any highly-available
        # storage methods (like DynamoDB or Firestore) are specified first, as this is what the
        # Teleport web UI uses as its source of events to display.
        audit_events_uri: ['dynamodb://events_table_name', 'firestore://events_table_name', 'file:///var/lib/teleport/log', 'stdout://']

        # Use this setting to configure teleport to store the recorded sessions in

    # By default an automatically generated name is used (not recommended)

    #
