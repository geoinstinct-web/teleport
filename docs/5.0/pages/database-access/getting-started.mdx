description: Getting started with Teleport Database Access and AWS Aurora PostgreSQL
---

# Getting Started

In this getting started guide we will use Teleport Database Access to connect
to a PostgreSQL flavored AWS Aurora database.

Here's an overview of what we will do:

1. Configure AWS Aurora database with IAM authentication.
2. Download and install Teleport and connect it to the Aurora database.
3. Connect to the Aurora database via Teleport.

## Step 1/3. Setup Aurora

In order to allow Teleport connections to an Aurora instance, it needs to support
IAM authentication.

If you don't have a database provisioned yet, create an instance of an Aurora
PostgreSQL in the [RDS control panel](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home).
Make sure to choose "Standard create" database creation method and enable
"Password and IAM database authentication" in the Database Authentication dialog.

For existing Aurora instances, the status of IAM authentication is displayed on
the Configuration tab and can be enabled by modifying the database instance.

Next, create the following IAM policy attached to a user whose credentials a
Teleport process will be using to allow it to connect to the database:

```json
{
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
      {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
             "rds-db:connect"
         ],
         "Resource": [
             "arn:aws:rds-db:<region>:<account-id>:dbuser:<resource-id>/*"
         ]
      }
   ]
}
```

<Admonition type="note" title="Resource ID">
Database resource ID is shown on the Configuration tab of a particular
database instance in RDS control panel, under "Resource id". For regular
RDS database it starts with `db-` prefix. For Aurora, use the database
cluster resource ID (`cluster-`), not individual instance ID.
</Admonition>

Finally, connect to the database and create a database account with IAM auth
support (or update an existing one). Once connected, execute the following
SQL statements to create a new database account and allow IAM auth for it:

```sql
CREATE USER alice;
GRANT rds_iam TO alice;
```

For more information about connecting to the PostgreSQL instance directly,
see Amazon [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ConnectToPostgreSQLInstance.html).

## Step 2/3. Setup Teleport

Teleport Database Access is available starting from `6.0.0-alpha.1` pre-release.

Download the appropriate version of Teleport for your platform from the table
below, or visit our [downloads page](https://goteleport.com/teleport/download).

{!docs/5.0/pages/preview/releases-table.mdx!}

<Admonition type="warning" title="Version Warning">
Note, pre-releases are not suitable for production usage!
</Admonition>

Start Teleport using the following command and point it to your Aurora database
instance. Make sure to update the database endpoint and region appropriately.

```shell
sudo teleport start \
  --roles=proxy,auth,db \
  --db-name=aurora \
  --db-protocol=postgres \
  --db-uri=postgres-aurora-instance-1.abcdefghijklm.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432 \
  --db-aws-region=us-west-1
```

<Admonition type="note" title="AWS Credentials">
The node where the Teleport process is started should have AWS credentials
configured with the policy from [step 1](#step-13-setup-aurora).
</Admonition>

Create a Teleport user that is allowed to connect to a particular database
(e.g. `postgres`) within the Aurora instance as a particular database account
(e.g. `alice`).

```shell
sudo tctl users add alice root \
  --db-names=postgres \
  --db-users=alice
```

## Step 3/3. Connect

Now that Aurora is configured with IAM authentication, Teleport is running and
the local user is created, we're ready to connect to the database.

Log into Teleport with the user we've just created. Make sure to use `tsh`
version `6.0.0-alpha.2` or newer that includes Database Access support.

For simplicity, we're using an `--insecure` flag to accept Teleport's
self-signed certificate. For production usage, make sure to configure proxy
with a proper certificate/key pair. See Teleport's general
[quickstart guide](../quickstart.mdx#step-1c-configure-domain-name-and-obtain-tls-certificates-using-lets-encrypt).

```shell
tsh login --insecure --proxy=localhost:3080 --user=alice
```

Now we can inspect available databases and retrieve credentials for the
configured Aurora instance:

```shell
tsh db ls
tsh db login aurora
```

Finally, connect to the database using `psql` command shown in the output of
`tsh db login` command, which looks similar to this:

```shell
psql "service=<cluster>-aurora user=alice dbname=postgres"
```
