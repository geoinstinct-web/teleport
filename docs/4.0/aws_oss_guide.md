# Running Teleport OSS on AWS

## Introduction 

This guide will cover how to setup, configure and run Teleport on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). This Guide is for the OSS version of Teleport, we've another 
enterprise guide in the works. 

 
## AWS Services used for high availability Teleport 

- [EC2](#ec2-autoscale)
- [DynamoDB](#dynamodb)
- [S3](#s3)
- [Route53](#route53) 
- [ELB](#elb-network-load-balancer)
- [IAM](#iam)
- [ACM](#acm)

We recommend setting up Teleport in high availability mode (HA). In HA mode DynamoDB 
and S3 become the store of state and the audit logs.

### EC2 / Autoscale
To run Teleport in a HA configuration we recommend using M8 ? instances and it's best
practice to separate the proxy and authentication server, creating auto-scale groups 
for both machines. We've a range of AMIs that have Teleport already built in it. 
Instructions on using these [AMIs are below](#).

### DynamoDB
DynamoDB is a  key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond 
performance at any scale. For large clusters you can provision usage but for smaller 
deployments you can leverage DynamoDBs auto-scale. 

Teleport 4.0 leverages DynamoDB streaming feature. When turning this on, you'll need
to specify `New Image` from the streaming options. DynamoDB back-end supports two 
types of Teleport data:

* Cluster state
* Audit log events

### S3 
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers
industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. In 
this setup of Teleport S3 will be the store of recorded sessions. 
 
We recommend using Amazon S3 Standard. 

!!! tip "Tip":
    S3 provides [Amazon S3 Object Lock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lock.html),
    which is useful for customers deploying Teleport in regulated environments. 

### Route53
Route53 is a highly available Domain Name System (DNS) provided by AWS. It'll be 
needed to setup a URL for the proxy, we recommend using a sub-domain. e.g. 
`teleport.acmeinc.com`

### ELB: Network Load Balancer
AWS provides many different load balancers. To setup Teleport, we recommend 
using a Network Load Balancer.  Network Load Balancers provides TLS for the Teleport 
proxy and provides the TCP connections needed for Teleport proxy SSH connections. 

### IAM
IAM is the recommend tool for creating service access. This guide will follow the 
best practice of principle of least privilege (PoLP). 


### ACM 
With AWS Certificate Manager, you can quickly request a certificate, deploy it on 
ACM-integrated AWS resources. 

- TLS Cert: Used to provide SSL for the proxy.
- SSL Certs: Created and self signed by the authentication server and given to machines

## Setting up a HA Teleport Cluster
Teleport config based setup offers a wide range of customization for customers. 
This guide offers a range of setup options for AWS. If you have a very large accounts,
multiple accounts, or over 10k users we would recommend getting in touch. We are
more than happy to help you architect, setup and deploy Teleport into your environment.

We have these options for you. 
- Using our AWS Marketplace ( Manual Setup )
- Using our AWS Marketplace ( Cloudformation Setup )
- Building your own base image ( Manual )
- Deploying with Cloudformation
- Deploying with Terraform 

Some of these providers will provision 

### Using OSS Teleport AMIs ( Manual Setup )
This guide provides instructions on deploying Teleport using AMIs                          

### Prerequisites 
- Obtain a Certificate
- Create Two Load Balancers
- Create S3 Bucket
- Create DynamoDB Instance

1. Generate and issue a certificate in [ACM](https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home?#) 
for `teleport.acmeinc.com`, use email or  DNS validation as appropriate and make sure 
itâ€™s approved successfully.

2.  With ACM you must use an application load balancer (ALB) and terminate SSL there
    1. Add the ACM certificate that you approved for `teleport.acmeinc.com`
    - Add a listener on the ALB for HTTPS on `443/tcp`
    - Target group will point to your instance - point to HTTP on `3080/tcp`
    - Create a DNS record for `teleport.acmeinc.com`
    - Point this to the public A record of the ALB as provided by Amazon

3. You also need to set up a network load balancer (NLB) for the auth traffic:
    1. Set up a listener on `3025/tcp`
    - Target group will point to your instance - point to `3025/tcp`
    - Create a DNS record for `teleport-nlb.acmeinc.com`
    - Point this to the public A record of the NLB as provided by Amazon
    - Make sure that your DNS record is also reflected in `TELEPORT_PROXY_SERVER_LB` in the user data
    - launch the instance (you can also use an already-running instance if you 
    follow the instructions at the bottom of this section)

#### Step 1: Subscribe to Teleport Community Edition 
Subscribe to the Teleport Community Edition on the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07FYTZB9B).

4. Make sure to write appropriate values to /etc/teleport.d/conf via user-data 
    (using something like this):

```bash 
#!/bin/bash
cat >/etc/teleport.d/conf <<EOF
USE_ACM="true"
TELEPORT_DOMAIN_NAME="teleport.acmeinc.com"
TELEPORT_EXTERNAL_HOSTNAME="teleport.acmeinc.com"
TELEPORT_EXTERNAL_PORT="443"
TELEPORT_PROXY_SERVER_LB="test-nlb.acmeinc.com:3025"
EOF
```

!!! note "Note":
    `TELEPORT_DOMAIN_NAME` and `TELEPORT_EXTERNAL_HOSTNAME` are more or less the 
    same thing but we keep them separate just in case you want to use a load balancer 
    on a different hostname. 

Te CA certificates for the server will be generated to have `TELEPORT_EXTERNAL_HOSTNAME` as a CN,
 assuming it's set when the server starts

#### Reconfiguring/using a pre-existing instance


- to reconfigure any of this, or to do it on a running instance:
-- make the appropriate changes to /etc/teleport.d/conf
-- rm -f /etc/teleport.yaml
-- systemctl restart teleport-generate-config.service
-- systemctl restart teleport-acm.service

- If you have changed the external hostname, you may need to delete /var/lib/teleport and start again?



### Building your own base image

### Deploying with Cloudformation

### Deploying with Terraform

## Adding your AWS fleet to Teleport. 
Best practices
- Turn off SSH / or setup in Proxy mode.
- How to build 

### Installing Teleport to EC2 Nodes
? Using 

### Generating labels from AWS tags

```bash
#!/bin/bash

LOCAL_IP=`curl --silent --fail --show-error http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/local-ipv4`
sed -ri "s/.*public_addr.*/    public_addr: ${LOCAL_IP}/" /etc/teleport/teleport.yaml

EXTERNAL_IP=`curl --silent --fail --show-error http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4`
if [ $? -eq 0 ]
then
  sed -ri "s/.*nodename.*/    nodename: ${EXTERNAL_IP}/" /etc/teleport/teleport.yaml
else
  sed -ri "s/.*nodename.*/    nodename: private-${LOCAL_IP}/" /etc/teleport/teleport.yaml
  sed -ri "s/.*\[curl, \"http:\/\/169.254.169.254\/latest\/meta-data\/public-ipv4\"\].*/        command: \[echo, \"n\/a\"\]/" /etc/teleport/teleport.yaml
fi
```

and in teleport.yaml I had:

```yaml
    commands:
      - name: arch
        command: [uname, -p]
        period: 1h0m0s
      - name: kernel
        command: [uname, -r]
        period: 1h0m0s
      - name: uptime
        command: [uptime, -p]
        period: 1h0m0s
      - name: internal
        command: [curl, "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/local-ipv4"]
        period: 1h0m0s
      - name: external
        command: [curl, "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4"]
        period: 1h0m0s
```

^ looks like it can be done with CLI

# Upgrading

To upgrade to a newer version of Teleport:
- Back up /etc/teleport.yaml and the contents of /var/lib/teleport
- Launch a new instance with the correct AMI for a newer version of Teleport
- Copy /etc/teleport.yaml and /var/lib/teleport to the new instance, overwriting anything that already exists
- Either restart the instance, or log in via SSH and run "sudo systemctl restart teleport.service"
