## Introduction

Gravitational Teleport ("Teleport") is a tool for remotely accessing isolated clusters of 
Linux servers via SSH or HTTPS. 

Unlike traditional key-based access, Teleport enables teams to easily adopt the following 
practices:

- Avoid key distribution and [trust on first use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_on_first_use) issues by using auto-expiring keys signed by a cluster certificate authority (CA).
- Enforce 2nd factor authentication.
- Connect to clusters located behind firewalls without direct Internet access via SSH bastions.
- Record and replay SSH sessions for knowledge sharing and auditing purposes.
- Collaboratively troubleshoot issues through session sharing.
- Discover online servers and Docker containers within a cluster with dynamic node labels.

Teleport is built on top of the high-quality [Golang SSH](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh) 
implementation and it is fully compatible with OpenSSH.

## Installing and Running

Download the latest binary release, unpack the .tar.gz and run `sudo make install`.
This will copy Teleport binaries into `/usr/local/bin` and the web assets 
to `/usr/local/share/teleport`.

Then you can run Teleport as a single-node cluster:

```
teleport start 
```

## Why Build Teleport?

Mature tech companies with significant infrastructure footprints tend to implement most
of these patterns internally. Teleport allows smaller companies without 
significant in-house SSH expertise to easily adopt them, as well. Teleport comes with an 
accesible Web UI and a very permissive [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/LICENSE)
license to facilitate adoption and use.

Being a complete standalone tool, Teleport can be used as a software library enabling 
trust management in complex multi-cluster, multi-region scenarios across many teams 
within multiple organizations.

The best way to contribute is to create issues or pull requests right here on Github. You can also reach the Gravitational team through their [website](http://gravitational.com/)

### Building

Teleport is written in Go. If you have Golang 1.5 and newer, simply clone this repository
and run `make`. You'll have to create `/var/lib/teleport` directory and then you can start 
Teleport as a single-node cluster in development mode: `build/teleport start -d`

## Status

**Teleport is not ready to be used in production yet**. Teleport is undergoing a comprehensive 
independent security audit.

## Who Built Teleport?

Teleport was created by [Gravitational Inc](https://gravitational.com). We have built Teleport 
by borrowing from our previous experiences at Rackspace. It has been extracted from [Gravity](http://gravitational.com/vendors.html), our system for helping our clients to deploy 
and remotely manage their SaaS applications on many cloud regions or even on-premise.
