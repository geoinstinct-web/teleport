  1. tctl will generate a signup token and give you a URL to share with a user.
     He will have to configure the mandatory 2nd facto auth and select a password.

  2. A Teleport user account is not the same as a local UNIX users on SSH nodes.
     You must assign a list of allowed local users for every Teleport login.

Examples:

  > tctl users add joe admin,nginx

  This creates a Teleport identity 'joe' who can login as 'admin' or 'nginx' 
  to any SSH node connected to this auth server.

  > tctl users add joe

  If the list of local users is not given, 'joe' will only be able to connect
  as 'joe' to SSH nodes.

  > tctl nodes add --roles=node,proxy --ttl=1h
